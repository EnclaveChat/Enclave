# Operators: Moderation and Operator Kit

Status: Draft (M0) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §12.4, §18 (operator program), RT-25, RT-28. Operator kit files live in `ops/operator-kit/`. This document fixes what operators can and cannot do, and what the kit must contain.

## 1. What operators can do (operators cannot see content)

| Action | Mechanism | Visible to users |
|---|---|---|
| Rate-limit | Server quotas, PoW effort, Privacy Pass issuance limits | Indirectly (slower sends, higher PoW) |
| Delete a reported blob | Delete by chunk ID from a report | The blob fails to download ("This file is no longer available.") |
| Disable a reported inbox or mailbox address | Mark the address disabled; writes get `DENIED` | Senders see "Couldn't deliver to Sam." after retries |
| Tombstone a username that breaks policy | KT tombstone entry: `[kt] withdrawn = ["name"]` in `server.toml`, applied at start (`12-servers.md` §3.5) | Visible in KT to anyone who looks the name up ("that name was withdrawn"); nobody can claim it again |
| Refuse registrations | Stop accepting `INBOX_REGISTER` or `KT_WRITE` | New users choose another server |

Operators MUST NOT be able to:

- read message content, capsules, or attachment content;
- learn who writes to an inbox, or link an inbox to a username, IP address, or device;
- add devices to an account, change a manifest, or forge a KT entry that witnesses will cosign;
- push a client update (updates are signed by maintainers, `19-ops.md`).

The software provides no admin interface that would suggest otherwise.

## 2. User reports

- A report is created by the user in the app: "Report" on a message or conversation. The user chooses what to include. Reports **voluntarily include the reported plaintext** and, for attachments, the blob pointer.
- Reports are sent through Enclave (end-to-end encrypted, over the mixnet) to the operator's report address published in the server descriptor.
- **Off-the-record chats:** a report is an unverifiable claim. The report UI says so: "Because this chat is off the record, the operator can't confirm who wrote these messages."
- **On-the-record chats:** the report includes the messages' composite signatures and the sender's manifest, so the operator can verify authorship.
- Spam reports on message requests additionally feed local blocking and, if the reporter agrees, raise the request-inbox PoW effort for that sender's capability.

**As implemented** (`enclave-core/src/client/reports.rs`, `enclave-server`, `enclave-rpc::api::ReportBody`).

- **Where reports go.** The operator's report address is its server: a report is `Op::Report` (11) to the **reported person's home server**, sealed to the request key in that server's descriptor like every request, so only its operator reads it. It costs the request-inbox proof of work of the descriptor's policy, spent once. There is no second address to publish or keep in step.
- **What it says.** The header's mailbox is the reported account's request inbox (from their contact card), the one handle an operator can act on. The body is `u8 version 1 ‖ u8 reason (1 spam, 2 harassment or threats, 3 other) ‖ u8 on_record ‖ u8 n ‖ n × (u16 length ‖ UTF-8)`: up to 10 quoted messages of at most 1,024 B each, chosen by the reporter (their latest, as they see them), or none. Nothing in it names the reporter. The server keeps at most 1,000 reports.
- **The app** offers **Report** on a message request and in the conversation sheet, with a reason, whether to quote, whether to block too, and, for spam, **"Make message requests cost more"**: for 30 days the reporter's server asks everyone writing to their request inbox for a proof of work of 256, then 1,024, … up to 16,384 on later reports (`Client::raise_request_effort`; `RegisterTokens` with `FLAG_EFFORT` and a `u32` payload, owner only, request inboxes only, at most `MAX_INBOX_EFFORT`). Senders' devices climb their effort ladder and still get through; someone sending many pays for each. After 30 days the client sets it back to the server's own (`relax_request_effort`). Tests `report_to_the_operator`, `an_owner_raises_what_requests_cost`.
- **The operator's console.** `enclave-server run` listens on `data_dir/admin.sock` (mode 0600, inside the server's container only) for one text command per connection (`enclave_server::admin`), and `enclave-admin reports` is its client: `docker compose exec server enclave-admin reports` lists waiting reports (id, day, reason, number of quotes, on or off the record, the request inbox), `reports show N` prints one with its quotes, `reports dismiss N` forgets it, `reports close-request-inbox HEX` closes the account's request inbox (no new requests, no replies to theirs). `enclave-admin console withdraw-username NAME` tombstones a name for breaking the policy, and `console stats` prints the aggregate counters. Tests `reports_through_the_console` (server), `reports_through_a_server_console` (the binary against a console socket).
- **Off the record.** All conversations are off the record today, so `on_record` is 0 and both the app and the console say the operator can't confirm who wrote the quotes. Verifiable reports from On-the-record chats (the quotes' composite signatures and the sender's manifest) come with On-the-record mode itself, milestone P3.

## 3. Law-enforcement guide (content requirements)

The kit's guide MUST list, per data type, what an operator **can** and **cannot** provide.

| Data | Can provide | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Account identity | No | The server has no accounts |
| Phone number, email | No | Never collected |
| IP addresses | No | Requests arrive through Nym and Tor; not logged |
| Message content | No | End-to-end encrypted; keys are only on devices |
| Contacts, group membership | No | Not visible to the server |
| Inbox activity (for a known inbox address) | Counts and 60 s timing buckets of writes and polls, from the moment logging is ordered | RT-28 residual: pseudonymous activity from that point on |
| Stored ciphertext | Yes, as opaque 14,336 B objects | Useless without device keys |
| Username → root hash mapping | Yes | Public in KT anyway |
| Push tokens | No | The server holds only sealed tokens; the push relay holds platform tokens but not inboxes |

The guide explains the reproducible-build process so that an operator can show a court which binary it runs.

## 4. Operator kit contents

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `terms-of-service.md` | Template terms, including the no-content-access statement |
| `acceptable-use.md` | Template AUP: spam, abuse, illegal content; enforcement actions limited to §1 |
| `transparency-report.md` | Template: requests received, by type and jurisdiction; actions taken (§1 table); requests refused |
| `law-enforcement-guide.md` | §3, with contact procedure and emergency-request policy |
| `gdpr-note.md` | Analysis of what personal data (if any) the server processes, legal basis, retention (30/90 days), data-subject rights handling |
| `data-processing-record.md` | GDPR Art. 30 record template for operators |
| `deployment.md` | Docker and Nix deployment, KT backup, key rotation, descriptor publishing |
| `operator-family.md` | How to declare an operator family and why honesty matters for call-relay separation |

## 5. Operator program

- Vetting, a code of practice, and jurisdiction diversity are run by the foundation (PLAN §18).
- Launch target (M11): at least 5 operators across at least 3 jurisdictions, and at least 5 witnesses.
- Operators publish an annual transparency report. There is no warrant canary.
- Operators MUST run reproducible builds of the published server release and MUST back up the KT database.

## Open questions

1. Whether operators should be able to raise the request-inbox PoW effort for a specific capability after spam reports (§2), since capability IDs could become a weak linking handle.
2. The report address format and whether reports should also be deliverable to the foundation when the operator does not respond.
