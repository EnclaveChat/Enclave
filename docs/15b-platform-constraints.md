# Platform Constraint Register

Status: Draft (M0) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §10, §13, §14, §17, §18, §22, Appendix A. This register lists every platform rule or limit that shapes Enclave's design. Each row has a status from PLAN Appendix A (**V** verified, **V\*** standard value from memory, **U** unresolved with an assigned check) and the milestone where it is checked or re-checked. Design responses MUST NOT assume a constraint away; if a constraint changes, update this register first.

## Open questions

1. PC-03 and PC-20 are unresolved and each has a spike; the fallbacks are already specified.
2. PC-22: whether to ship OEM-specific guidance screens (per manufacturer) or link to external documentation.
3. PC-44: whether Windows 10 versions older than 2004 should be supported with a warning instead of refused.
