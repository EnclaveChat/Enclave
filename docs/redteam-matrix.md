# Red-Team Matrix

Status: Draft (M0) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §1.4 and §21. Every row maps to at least one specification section and at least one named test. Tests live in `tests/` or in `enclave-sim` scenarios, and each test name below MUST exist in CI by the milestone listed. A row whose test is missing or failing blocks the milestone's exit gate. Adversary capability tags (A-GPO, A-NET, and so on) are defined in `01-threat-model.md` §2.

Test naming: `rtNN_<short_description>`. When a row needs several tests they share the prefix. "Sim" means an `enclave-sim` adversary scenario; "Shape" means `cargo xtask shape`; "Unit" means a crate unit or integration test; "E2E" means the end-to-end harness; "Manual" means a scripted manual check recorded in the release checklist.

## 1. Matrix

### RT-01 Long-term intersection attack
- **Adversary:** A-GPO, A-INF.
- **Attack:** Correlate when you are online with writes to an inbox, over weeks or months.
- **Fix:** Always-on Background profile on Android and desktop. Fixed send slots on the tick schedule. Unlinkable single-use write tokens. Push wakes quantized into 60 s windows. Maximum privacy mode.
- **Residual:** iOS app-open times remain visible. A pair who talk often can be narrowed down over months.
- **Spec:** `09-transport.md` §3, §6; `10-push.md` §3.
- **Tests:** `rt01_background_profile_constant_when_idle` (Shape, M4); `rt01_send_slots_independent_of_real_traffic` (Shape, M4); `rt01_tokens_unlinkable_across_writes` (Sim, M3).
- **Milestone:** M3, M4.

### RT-02 n-1 attack or flooding by a malicious gateway or mix
- **Adversary:** A-INF, A-NET.
- **Attack:** Hold back or flood all traffic except the target's to isolate one message.
- **Fix:** Nym loop cover (1 per 10 s in Foreground and Maximum, 1 per tick in Background). Enclave self-loop probes. If loss exceeds 10% or latency exceeds 5× the rolling median, the client switches gateway and records a local event.
- **Residual:** A single message can be targeted this way.
- **Spec:** `09-transport.md` §6.4.
- **Tests:** `rt02_gateway_switch_on_loss_over_10pct` (Sim, M4); `rt02_gateway_switch_on_latency_over_5x_median` (Sim, M4).
- **Milestone:** M4.

### RT-03 Active tagging of Sphinx packets
- **Adversary:** A-INF, A-NET.
- **Attack:** Modify packet bits at one hop and watch for the malformed result downstream.
- **Fix:** A tagged unit fails the EnclaveSeal tag check at the server and is dropped with no distinguishable response. Tor hides the client IP from the gateway.
- **Residual:** A colluding gateway and server can learn "this Tor circuit talks to server S".
- **Spec:** `02-cryptography.md` §4.4; `09-transport.md` §2.
- **Tests:** `rt03_bitflip_in_any_unit_byte_rejected` (Unit, M1); `rt03_rejected_request_gets_no_distinct_reply` (Sim, M3).
- **Milestone:** M1, M3.

### RT-04 Key-transparency split view
- **Adversary:** A-INF.
- **Attack:** Show different users different keys for the same username.
- **Fix:** Tree heads are valid only with ≥3 independent witness cosignatures (≥2 during beta, at least one from another operator). Head digests are gossiped in message padding. Clients audit their own entries anonymously. Security codes remain available.
- **Residual:** A colluding witness quorum against a target who has checked no contacts.
- **Spec:** `12-servers.md` §3; `08-envelope.md` §5.6.
- **Tests:** `rt04_split_view_detected_by_gossip` (Sim, M3); `rt04_head_rejected_below_witness_quorum` (Unit, M3); `rt04_self_audit_detects_foreign_entry` (Sim, M3).
- **Milestone:** M3.

### RT-05 Malicious prekey server
- **Adversary:** A-INF.
- **Attack:** Withhold or replay prekeys.
- **Fix:** Signed prekeys expire after 14 days. Responders keep a replay cache of initial-message hashes for the signed prekey's lifetime plus 7 days. The bundle epoch is committed in the manifest.
- **Residual:** If the one-time prekey is withheld, forward secrecy for the first message rests only on the signed prekey.
- **Spec:** `04-eqxdh.md` §2, §10.
- **Tests:** `rt05_replayed_initial_message_rejected` (Sim, M2); `rt05_expired_spk_rejected` (Unit, M2); `rt05_bundle_epoch_mismatch_rejected` (Unit, M2).
- **Milestone:** M2.

### RT-06 Draining one-time prekeys
- **Adversary:** A-INF, A-SOC.
- **Attack:** Claim all one-time prekeys to force weaker first messages.
- **Fix:** Equi-X proof-of-work to claim one. A last-resort PQ prekey rotates every 7 days.
- **Residual:** An attacker can force use of the last-resort key.
- **Spec:** `04-eqxdh.md` §2.3; `02-cryptography.md` §10.
- **Tests:** `rt06_opk_claim_requires_pow` (Unit, M3); `rt06_last_resort_used_when_drained` (Sim, M3).
- **Milestone:** M3.

### RT-07 Downgrade
- **Adversary:** A-NET, A-INF.
- **Attack:** Strip the PQ or McEliece parts, or switch modes.
- **Fix:** No negotiation in v1. Suite ID, `H512(McE_pk)`, and mode are bound into the manifest, the transcript, and associated data. Mode changes are in-band authenticated events shown in the UI. The fallback transport requires user consent.
- **Residual:** An attacker can delay the McEliece braid; the session still has X448 + ML-KEM-1024.
- **Spec:** `02-cryptography.md` §5; `04-eqxdh.md` §7, §11; `05-ratchet.md` §9.
- **Tests:** `rt07_stripped_mceliece_rejected` (Unit, M1 for the combiner, Sim M2 for the protocol); `rt07_psk_flag_downgrade_rejected` (Unit, M1); `rt07_kem2_kem3_label_confusion_rejected` (Unit, M1); `rt07_mode_switch_requires_authenticated_event` (Unit, M2).
- **Milestone:** M1, M2.

### RT-08 State rollback from a snapshot or backup
- **Adversary:** A-DEV.
- **Attack:** Restore an old copy of device state to force nonce or key reuse.
- **Fix:** Hedged nonces and hedged RNG. Backups exclude ratchet state. The database is excluded from OS backups.
- **Residual:** Old messages could be accepted again, but confidentiality is never lost. Device-slot headers use a detached nonce and can leak the XOR of two slot headers under rollback (`05-ratchet.md` §6.4).
- **Spec:** `02-cryptography.md` §4, §6; `14-storage.md` §4.
- **Tests:** `rt08_rollback_no_keystream_reuse` (Unit, M1); `rt08_backup_contains_no_ratchet_state` (Unit, M5); `rt08_db_excluded_from_os_backup` (Manual, M5).
- **Milestone:** M1, M5.

### RT-09 Device-link phishing
- **Adversary:** A-SOC.
- **Attack:** Trick a user into scanning an attacker's link QR code.
- **Fix:** Linking starts only from Settings → Your devices. The link QR uses a distinct URI type that the general scanner and deep links refuse. Pick-1-of-4 phrase check. History transfer waits 24 h. A banner on every device for 7 days. Inactive linked devices expire after 30 days.
- **Residual:** A user who is socially engineered through every step.
- **Spec:** `03-identity.md` §4.
- **Tests:** `rt09_link_qr_refused_by_general_scanner` (Unit, M5); `rt09_link_qr_refused_by_deep_link` (Unit, M5); `rt09_history_transfer_delayed_24h` (Sim, M5); `rt09_new_device_banner_7_days` (Unit, M6).
- **Milestone:** M5, M6.

### RT-10 Invite links leaking
- **Adversary:** A-SOC, A-INF.
- **Attack:** A leaked invite link is used by strangers.
- **Fix:** The secret lives in the URL fragment. Links are limited-use, expire, and can be revoked. Requests land in quarantine (Message requests).
- **Residual:** Spam requests until the link is revoked.
- **Spec:** `03-identity.md` §9; `09-transport.md` §4.
- **Tests:** `rt10_invite_secret_only_in_fragment` (Unit, M5); `rt10_revoked_invite_rejected` (Sim, M5); `rt10_invite_use_limit_enforced` (Sim, M5).
- **Milestone:** M5.

### RT-11 Malicious admin forking group state
- **Adversary:** A-SOC (insider).
- **Attack:** Show different members different group states.
- **Fix:** Group state is a hash chain. Every message carries the state hash and a causal frontier. Membership changes are always shown in the chat.
- **Residual:** Admins can legitimately add people, and everyone sees it.
- **Spec:** `07-groups.md` §7.
- **Tests:** `rt11_group_fork_detected` (Sim, M7); `rt11_equivocation_detected_via_frontier` (Sim, M7); `rt11_membership_change_rendered_in_chat` (Unit, M7).
- **Milestone:** M7.

### RT-12 Fingerprinting the cover-traffic implementation
- **Adversary:** A-GPO.
- **Attack:** Distinguish Enclave users or individual clients by traffic shape.
- **Fix:** Three global profiles. Packet-paced traffic. Nym default delays. Profile changes only at foreground/background transitions.

- **Spec:** `09-transport.md` §6.
- **Tests:** `rt12_profiles_identical_across_clients` (Shape, M4); `rt12_profile_change_only_on_visibility_transition` (Unit, M4).
- **Milestone:** M4.

- **Adversary:** A-SUP, A-LEG.
- **Attack:** Serve one user a backdoored build.
- **Fix:** Reproducible builds. TUF with 2-of-3 SLH-DSA + Ed448 maintainer signatures. Sigsum log. Update manifests fetched over the mixnet.
- **Residual:** App stores can serve a targeted binary. Detectable, not preventable.
- **Spec:** `19-ops.md` §1.
- **Tests:** `rt13_update_rejected_without_2_of_3` (Unit, M10); `rt13_update_rejected_without_sigsum_inclusion` (Unit, M10); `rt13_reproducible_build_diff_empty` (CI, M10).
- **Milestone:** M10.

### RT-14 Crate supply chain
- **Adversary:** A-SUP.
- **Attack:** A malicious or compromised dependency.
- **Fix:** `cargo vet`, `cargo deny`, vendoring, a build.rs and proc-macro allowlist, hermetic Nix builds, and the process split.
- **Residual:** iOS runs as a single process.
- **Spec:** `19-ops.md` §2; `15-client.md` §1.
- **Tests:** `rt14_netd_has_no_key_material` (Unit, M5); `rt14_build_rs_allowlist_enforced` (CI, M0); `rt14_cargo_vet_complete_for_crypto_and_parsers` (CI, M1).
- **Milestone:** M0, M1, M5.

### RT-15 Side channels in the crypto
- **Adversary:** A-DEV (co-resident), A-NET (remote timing).
- **Attack:** Timing or cache side channels.
- **Fix:** `subtle` for comparisons. dudect and ctgrind/secret-poisoning tests. ARM DIT bit. Hardware AES or bitsliced (fixslice) fallback. `mlock`. Core dumps disabled.
- **Residual:** Physical, power, and EM side channels.
- **Spec:** `02-cryptography.md` §12.
- **Tests:** `rt15_dudect_mac_compare` (CI, M1); `rt15_ctgrind_mlkem_decap` (CI, M1); `rt15_ctgrind_mceliece_decap` (CI, M1); `rt15_dit_bit_set_during_crypto` (Unit, M1).
- **Milestone:** M1.

### RT-16 iOS push timing
- **Adversary:** A-LEG (Apple), A-GPO.
- **Attack:** Use APNs wake timing to infer activity.
- **Fix:** 60 s windows. 0 to 30 s jitter. Dummy wakes only with Apple's filtering entitlement. Fixed-size capsule. A "Notifications off" option.
- **Residual:** Apple learns which windows had at least one message.
- **Spec:** `10-push.md` §3, §5.
- **Tests:** `rt16_one_wake_per_window` (Sim, M4); `rt16_capsule_always_1024_bytes` (Unit, M2).

- **Tests:** `rt17_attachment_padded_to_bucket` (Unit, M1); `rt17_fetch_includes_decoys` (Sim, M4); `rt17_blob_ids_not_content_derived` (Unit, M1).
- **Milestone:** M1, M4.

### RT-18 Colluding call relays plus a global observer
- **Adversary:** A-INF, A-GPO.
- **Attack:** Link both call legs by timing.
- **Fix:** Each side picks a relay from a different operator family. PQ PSK obtained anonymously. Maximum mode keeps a constant audio-shaped tunnel open.
- **Residual:** Call start and stop times without Maximum mode.
- **Spec:** `11-calls.md` §3, §7.
- **Tests:** `rt18_relays_from_distinct_operator_families` (Unit, M8); `rt18_max_mode_tunnel_constant` (Shape, M8).
- **Milestone:** M8.

### RT-19 Traffic analysis of CBR media
- **Adversary:** A-GPO, A-INF.
- **Attack:** Infer speech or activity from packet sizes and rates.
- **Fix:** Opus CBR, DTX off. RFC 6464 audio-level extension forbidden. Fixed packet size and rate. Padding while muted or with the camera off. Quality can only step down.
- **Residual:** Audio-only vs. video tier is visible.
- **Spec:** `11-calls.md` §6.
- **Tests:** `rt19_call_packets_constant_size_and_rate` (Shape, M8); `rt19_rfc6464_extension_rejected` (Unit, M8); `rt19_mute_keeps_rate` (Shape, M8).

### RT-20 Deanonymizing push tokens
- **Adversary:** A-INF, A-LEG.
- **Attack:** Link a device's mailboxes or server through its push token.
- **Fix:** Tokens are sealed to the relay and re-randomized on each registration. The relay is reached over Nym. The Android default avoids FCM.
- **Residual:** On iOS, activity windows can be tied to a device.
- **Spec:** `10-push.md` §2.
- **Tests:** `rt20_sealed_token_differs_per_registration` (Unit, M4); `rt20_server_never_sees_plain_token` (Sim, M4).
- **Milestone:** M4.

### RT-21 Temporary device compromise
- **Adversary:** A-DEV.
- **Attack:** Copy all device state, then leave.
- **Fix:** 1:1 heals in one round trip. Groups heal on the next rekey. "Secure my account" rotates everything. Root operations are gated by a PIN.
- **Residual:** Message history already on the device is exposed.
- **Spec:** `05-ratchet.md` §8; `07-groups.md` §8; `03-identity.md` §5.
- **Tests:** `rt21_pcs_after_one_round_trip` (Sim, M2); `rt21_group_pcs_after_rekey` (Sim, M7); `rt21_secure_my_account_rotates_all` (E2E, M5).
- **Milestone:** M2, M5, M7.

### RT-22 Theft of the recovery words
- **Adversary:** A-SOC, A-DEV.
- **Attack:** Use stolen words to take over the account.
- **Fix:** Root actions without a co-signature from an existing device wait 72 h and can be vetoed by any device. Contacts' clients enforce the delay.
- **Residual:** Recovery is slow if every device is lost.
- **Spec:** `03-identity.md` §8.1.
- **Tests:** `rt22_pending_root_veto_honored` (Sim, M5); `rt22_contacts_enforce_72h` (Sim, M5).
- **Milestone:** M5.

### RT-23 Clock manipulation
- **Adversary:** A-NET, A-DEV.
- **Attack:** Shift the device clock to accept expired keys or break timers.
- **Fix:** Trusted time is the median of witness timestamps. Skew warnings. Disappearing timers run on local monotonic time after receipt.
- **Residual:** A device that is offline and has had its clock tampered with.
- **Spec:** `12-servers.md` §3.5.
- **Tests:** `rt23_clock_skew_warning_shown` (Sim, M5); `rt23_disappearing_timer_uses_monotonic` (Unit, M6).
- **Milestone:** M5, M6.

### RT-24 Server replays or delays messages
- **Adversary:** A-INF.
- **Attack:** Deliver a message twice, or hold it back.
- **Fix:** Counters, skipped-key cache, and single-use tokens. "Delivered late" indicator. Gap notice after 60 s.
- **Residual:** A server can still drop messages. Probes detect it.
- **Spec:** `05-ratchet.md` §10, §11; `09-transport.md` §3.
- **Tests:** `rt24_replayed_message_rejected` (Sim, M2); `rt24_gap_notice_after_60s` (Sim, M2); `rt24_token_reuse_rejected` (Unit, M3).

### RT-25 Spam and Sybil accounts with no identity
- **Adversary:** A-SOC.
- **Attack:** Mass requests from free accounts.
- **Fix:** Invite capability or Equi-X PoW. Text-only requests. Quotas. Local blocking.
- **Residual:** Well-funded PoW spam can still reach the requests folder.
- **Spec:** `09-transport.md` §4; `13-operators.md` §1.
- **Tests:** `rt25_request_requires_pow_or_capability` (Unit, M3); `rt25_request_inbox_caps_at_100` (Unit, M3); `rt25_request_media_stripped` (Unit, M6).

- **Attack:** Break recorded Sphinx and Tor layers after 2035.
- **Fix:** Sealed requests (X448 + ML-KEM-1024) to a daily server key that is deleted after use.
- **Residual:** Recorded traffic reveals routing, but not mailbox IDs or content.
- **Spec:** `09-transport.md` §2.
- **Tests:** `rt27_request_fields_only_inside_pq_seal` (Unit, M1); `rt27_server_request_key_deleted_after_rotation` (Unit, M3).
- **Milestone:** M1, M3.

### RT-28 Operators legally compelled to log
- **Adversary:** A-LEG.
- **Attack:** Force an operator to start logging.
- **Fix:** Nothing identifying to log. Reproducible server builds.
- **Residual:** Pseudonymous inbox activity from that point on.

## Open questions

1. RT-01 has no quantitative acceptance threshold. A candidate metric is the number of weeks of observation needed for a simulated intersection attacker to rank a true contact pair in the top 10 among 10,000 users, measured in `enclave-sim` at M4.
2. RT-16 depends on Apple granting the filtering entitlement; if it is refused, the residual grows to "Apple learns every window with a message, with no dummy windows". This needs a written decision at M6.
