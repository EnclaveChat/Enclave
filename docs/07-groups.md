# Groups (up to 100 members)

Status: Implemented in `enclave-proto::group` (M7) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §7 (D6). Crate: `enclave-proto` (MAC vectors, exporter rekey, frontier). Derivations: `02b-key-schedule.md` §8. Layouts: `08-envelope.md` §7 (message unit) and §8 (rekey unit). There is no MLS.

## 1. Model

- A group has a random 32 B `group_id`, a **state** (§7), an **epoch** (a `u32` that increments on every membership or device-list change), and an `epoch_secret` known to current members.
- Every member device `s` has a **sender chain** per **generation** `g` (`u8`, increments on each rotation, wraps with the epoch). Messages from `s` are encrypted with keys from its chain.
- Every member device `s` also has, per generation, one **MAC key per other member account** `j`, `mac_key[s→j]`, delivered only to account `j`'s devices.
- Delivery is one unit per message to the group mailbox on the host server (normally the creator's home server). Pairwise Lockstep sessions between member devices carry all key material.
- Maximum 100 member accounts. Each account may have up to 5 devices, so up to 500 devices.

## 2. Sender chains

```
cs_0 = HedgedRng.fill("grp-chain-seed", 32)                  # per (sender device, generation)
(cs_{n+1}, gmk_n) = split32( KMAC256(cs_n, "", 512, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-chain") )
```

Message `n` of generation `g` from device `s` is sealed under `gmk_n`. Receivers keep skipped `gmk` values under the same limits as 1:1 (1,000 per sender device, 7 days). `cs_n` and used `gmk_n` are deleted as the chain advances.

## 3. Message authentication (MAC vectors)

Every group message carries a MAC vector of **99 entries × 16 B = 1,584 B**, always full.

- Entry position: members are ordered by the member index in the group state (0 to 99). The vector has one entry for every member index except the sender's own account; position `p` holds the tag for the member with index `p` if `p` is less than the sender's index, otherwise index `p + 1`. Positions with no member hold random bytes.
- Tag computation:

  ```
  covered = unit[0..88] ‖ unit[2696..14336]                   # routing header and sealed body (08-envelope.md §7)
  tag_j   = KMAC256(mac_key[s→j], H512(covered), 128, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-mac")
  ```

- A receiving device of account `j` verifies its entry in constant time **before** opening the body. A failed MAC drops the unit.
- Insiders cannot forge each other's messages (they lack `mac_key[s→j]` for other `j`), and there is no signature that proves authorship to outsiders. This makes group messages deniable and post-quantum.
- **Own devices.** The vector has no entry for the sender's own account. A device does not accept, from the mailbox alone, a message that claims to come from another device of its own account. It shows it after own-device sync (`06-multidevice.md` §5) confirms the message's `grp_msg_id`; sync of sent group-message IDs is batched and sent within 60 s in the Foreground profile.
- **On-the-record groups** additionally carry a composite device signature in the content:

  ```
  sig = CompositeSign(device_sk, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-signed-msg",
                      group_id ‖ u32(epoch) ‖ sender_device_id ‖ u8(generation) ‖ u32(counter)
                      ‖ state_hash ‖ H512(plaintext_content))
  ```

## 4. Delivery

- **Mailbox address:** `gmbox(d) = KMAC256(epoch_secret, u32(d), 256, "enclave/v1/net/grp-mailbox")` for day `d` (PLAN: `KMAC(epoch_secret, "gmbox"‖day)`). A sender writes to the address for the current trusted day. Readers poll today's and yesterday's address.
- **Write authorization (epoch MAC tokens):** `grp_write_tok(a) = KMAC256(k_gw, a, 256, "enclave/v1/net/grp-write-token")`. The first write to an address that does not exist yet carries the `CREATE` flag; the server stores `KMAC256(a, token, 256, "enclave/v1/net/token-hash")` and accepts later writes that present the same token. Group write tokens are multi-use for one address; the server can already link writes to one mailbox.
- **Read authorization:** `grp_read_cred(a) = KMAC256(k_gr, a, 256, "enclave/v1/net/grp-read-cred")`, registered the same way with `cred-hash`.
- **Routing header:** the 88 B header is sealed under `HKg = KMAC256(epoch_secret, "", 256, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-header")` and carries epoch, sender member index, sender device index, generation, flags, and counter (`08-envelope.md` §7.1).
- **Cost:** 1 unit per group message. No self-copy (own devices read the mailbox).
- **Hosting move:** admins may move the mailbox host to another server by an admin vote (a state update naming the new host, applied by a majority of admins). The new host takes effect from the next day's address.

## 5. Rekey (DCGKA-style exporter broadcast)

### 5.1 When

- **Membership or device-list change:** the member who performs the change (the remover, or the admin who adds) creates a new epoch and rotates immediately. Every other member rotates before its next send in the new epoch.
- **Otherwise (lazy):** a sender device rotates on its first send after 24 h or after 200 messages in its current generation.
- **"Secure my account"** rotates the user's sender chains in every group.

### 5.2 Pre-rekey PQ step

Before a rekey, the rotating device `s` checks each pairwise session with a recipient device. If the pair's most recent PQ epoch in either direction was established before the group's last epoch change, `s` sends a `ForcePQStep` control message and waits for a completed PQ exchange (up to 10 minutes in the Foreground profile, up to 1 hour otherwise). Pairs that do not complete in time are still included, and the rotation is marked "pre-step incomplete" locally so the next rotation retries them. This makes the rekey post-compromise secure against a compromise that ended before the rekey.

### 5.3 Exporter key

For each recipient device `r`, `s` uses its pairwise session with `r`:

```
k  = chain_index of the most recent chain in (s, r) created by r        # r certainly has its RK snapshot
e  = epoch of the most recent PQ epoch in r's send direction as seen by s   # r has this P as its pq_s snapshot
K_exp = KMAC256(P_e ‖ RK_k, T(group_id, u32(epoch), u8(generation)), 256, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-export")
```

This is PLAN's `K_exp = KMAC(PQ_epoch_secret‖DR_root, "grp-export"‖group_id‖epoch)`. Both `RK_k` and `P_e` come from the snapshots kept by `05-ratchet.md` §2 (at most 4 each, 7-day expiry). The entry carries `k mod 2^16` and `e mod 2^16` so that `r` can find them.

### 5.4 Broadcast contents

```
kb     = HedgedRng.fill("grp-rekey-kb", 32)
common = Seal(kb, E("enclave/v1/wire/ad-rekey-common") ‖ group_id ‖ u32(epoch) ‖ sender_device_id ‖ u8(generation),
              new_cs_0 (32) ‖ u8(generation) ‖ u8(flags) ‖ new_epoch_secret or random (32)
              ‖ u32(new_epoch) ‖ state_hash (32) ‖ 0^26)                           # 128 B plaintext, 200 B sealed
for each recipient device r (every device of every other member, and this account's other devices):
    j   = account of r
    pad = KMAC256(K_exp_r, "", 512, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-rekey-pad")
    ct  = (kb ‖ mac_key[s→j]) ⊕ pad                             # own-account devices get 32 zero bytes as MAC key
    chk = KMAC256(K_exp_r, ct, 96, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-rekey-check")
    entry_r = u16(k) ‖ u16(e) ‖ chk (12) ‖ ct (64)              # 80 B
```

Each entry is about 72 B of key material plus 8 B of indexing (PLAN: "about 72 B per device").

### 5.5 Buckets

- `bucket(r) = u16(KMAC256(k_bucket, device_id_r, 256, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-bucket-index")[0..2]) mod 3`, where `k_bucket = KMAC256(epoch_secret, "", 256, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-bucket")`. Only members can compute it.
- A rekey is always **exactly 3 rekey units**, one per bucket, each holding up to 174 entries (`08-envelope.md` §8). Unused entry positions are random.
- If a bucket has more than 174 entries, the excess goes to the next bucket (`b + 1 mod 3`). Capacity is 522 ≥ 500.
- Unit `b` is written to the bucket sub-mailbox `gbkt(d, b) = KMAC256(k_bucket, u32(d) ‖ u8(b), 256, "enclave/v1/net/grp-rekey-mailbox")` for the current day `d`. A device fetches only its own bucket's sub-mailbox (and the next one only if its entry is not found).
- A device learns that it needs a rekey when it sees a message header from `s` with a generation it does not have. It then fetches its bucket.

Cost: 3 units per rotation for 100 members × 5 devices, versus about 500 units for pairwise delivery.

### 5.6 Processing a rekey entry

```
for each entry in the fetched bucket unit (and the next bucket if needed):
    look up snapshots RK_k, P_e by (k, e); if missing, continue
    K_exp = …; chk' = KMAC256(K_exp, entry.ct, 96, …)
    if ct_eq(chk', entry.chk):
        (kb, mac_key) = entry.ct ⊕ KMAC256(K_exp, "", 512, …)
        common = Open(kb, AD, common)                       else drop rekey
        install sender chain (s, generation) and mac_key; if new epoch: install epoch secret
        return
report "missing rekey from s" locally; ask s with a pairwise control message after 60 s
```

## 6. Cadence summary

| Event | Who rotates | When |
|---|---|---|
| Member removed | The remover | Immediately (new epoch) |
| Member or device added | The adding admin | Immediately (new epoch) |
| Device list of a member changes | That member | Immediately (new epoch); others before next send |
| Other members after an epoch change | Each member device | Before its next send |
| Lazy | Each sender device | First send after 24 h or 200 messages |
| "Secure my account" | That account's devices | Immediately |

**Group post-compromise security is one epoch** (or one generation for a single sender's chain), documented in the help.

## 7. Group state

### 7.1 Contents

The state is a canonical Protobuf message (`08-envelope.md` §5.6 limits) with: `group_id`, `epoch`, name, avatar (blob pointer), disappearing timer, join policy (invite links on/off, admin approval on/off), "only admins can send", member list (per member: `root_hash`, member index, role admin or member, joined time, group-scoped request capability, current manifest hash), and host server.

### 7.2 Hash chain

```
state_hash_0 = ID256("enclave/v1/proto/grp-state", 0^32 ‖ H512(creation_update))
state_hash_n = ID256("enclave/v1/proto/grp-state", state_hash_{n-1} ‖ H512(update_n))
```

### 7.3 Updates

- A state update is a group message with flag `STATE_UPDATE`. Its MAC vector uses the **admin MAC** label: `KMAC256(mac_key[s→j], H512(covered), 128, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-admin-mac")`. Receivers accept it only if the sender is an admin in the parent state (or the update is a member leaving, which any member may post about themselves).
- On-the-record groups additionally require a composite signature with use label `enclave/v1/proto/grp-admin-sig` over `group_id ‖ state_hash_{n-1} ‖ H512(update_n)`.
- **Every membership change is shown in the chat** as an inline event ("Alex added Priya.") with no option to hide it.
- If the last admin leaves, the longest-standing member (earliest `joined`, ties broken by lowest `root_hash`) is promoted automatically by every client.

### 7.4 State hash and causal frontier on every message

- Every group message carries, inside its body seal, the sender's current `state_hash` (32 B) and a **causal frontier**: for each member index 0 to 99, the 8 B `grp_msg_id` of the last message the sender has seen from that member (zero if none). 100 × 8 = 800 B.

  ```
  grp_msg_id = ID256("enclave/v1/proto/grp-msg-id", group_id ‖ u32(epoch) ‖ u8(member) ‖ u8(device) ‖ u8(gen) ‖ u32(counter))[0..8]
  ```

- A receiver compares the message's `state_hash` with its own and checks that every frontier entry names a message it has seen (or one it is missing, which triggers a fetch). If a mismatch persists for more than 10 minutes, the chat shows: "Some people in this group may be seeing different messages." (RT-11)
- **Forks:** two valid updates with the same parent resolve by lowest resulting `state_hash`. The losing update's author re-applies its change on top of the winner if it is still valid, and the UI shows the result.

### 7.5 Polls

A poll close carries `tally_hash = H512(E("enclave/v1/proto/poll-tally-hash") ‖ poll_id ‖ canonical_tally)`, authenticated by the poll creator. In On-the-record groups the creator signs it with use label `enclave/v1/proto/poll-tally`. In Off-the-record groups the close message's MAC vector authenticates it (deniable).

## 8. Post-compromise security

- A device compromise that ends is healed for that device's outgoing messages when it next rotates (new `cs_0` and MAC keys, distributed under fresh `K_exp` after the pre-rekey PQ step).
- It is healed for incoming messages when every other sender rotates, which the next epoch change forces.
- Removed members lose access at the new epoch: they receive no rekey entry, and the mailbox address changes.

## 9. Joining

- **Invite links** carry a capability in the URL fragment: `https://<invite-host>/g#<payload>`, where the payload holds `group_id`, an admin's contact fields (as `03-identity.md` §9.2), and `grp_invite_secret`. `grp_invite_cap = KMAC256(grp_invite_secret, "", 256, "enclave/v1/proto/grp-invite-cap")`.
- Links are limited-use (default 1 use for links sent to contacts), expire (default 7 days), and can be revoked by any admin. **Admin approval is on by default.**
- Flow: the joiner sends a `JoinRequest{grp_invite_cap}` to the admin as a first-contact message (`04-eqxdh.md`). The admin (after approval, if required) posts a state update adding the joiner, starts a new epoch, and sends the joiner the state and epoch secret over their pairwise session.
- The joiner then establishes pairwise sessions with every member device, starting with `kem_count = 2` (group-only peers, `04-eqxdh.md` §8), using each member's group-scoped request capability so these first contacts are not shown as message requests. Joining costs about 99 × 60 KB ≈ 6 MB of manifests and bundles in bulk mode, with a progress bar.
- **New members cannot read history from before they joined.** They receive no chain seeds from earlier epochs.

## 10. Errors

| Rekey entry not found in bucket or next | Ask the sender after 60 s |
| Group exceeds 100 members | Refuse the add with "Groups can have up to 100 people." |

## Implementation notes (M7)

`crates/enclave-proto/src/group.rs`, tests in `crates/enclave-proto/tests/group.rs`. Where this section and the text above differ, this section describes the code.

1. **Stable member indices.** Removing a member leaves a tombstone slot (`active = false`) that a later joiner can reuse. Indices never shift, so MAC-vector positions computed from the sender's state stay valid while an update is in flight.
2. **Exporter key.** `K_exp` is derived from the pairwise session's PQ root history instead of retained DR root snapshots (open question 3): the sender uses the newest root of the recipient's sending direction (`Session::export_for_peer`), and the recipient looks up the same root by its epoch in its own history of 16 (`Session::export_from_peer`). Every root comes from ML-KEM-1024 steps seeded by the handshake, so the key is post-quantum and heals with each PQ round trip. The entry carries the epoch as a `u32`.
3. **Header protection** (resolves `08-envelope.md` I-14). The sender identity, state hash and causal frontier are encrypted under a KMAC256 keystream keyed by the epoch's header key and a per-unit 32 B nonce. The MAC vector (over `unit[0..920] ‖ unit[2504..]`) authenticates them. The server sees only the epoch number and the unit kind.
4. **Rekey units.** Layout: clear header 16 (kind Group, subkind 1, bucket, announce epoch) ‖ nonce 32 ‖ encrypted sender 40 (member, device, generation, flags, target epoch) ‖ common blob 192 (sealed under `kb`, AD = header with the bucket byte zeroed) ‖ 174 × 80 B entries ‖ random padding. Entries are shuffled within each bucket.
5. **New epochs.** A rotation that starts an epoch is announced under the previous epoch, which current members hold; a removed member can read the header but finds no entry. A joiner never gets the previous epoch: its welcome (sent pairwise) carries the state, the new epoch secret, and the welcoming admin's current chain seed and MAC key for the joiner.
6. **Own-account messages** are marked `own_account` and not MAC-checked (there is no entry for the sender's own account); the client shows them only after own-device sync confirms them.
7. **Client** (`enclave-core/src/client/groups.rs`): the creator sends each member a welcome and the members' contact cards over pairwise sessions. Members who are not contacts introduce themselves through the group: a Hello naming the group is accepted automatically when the sender is a member, and such contacts stay out of the conversation list. Each sync polls the mailbox and the three rekey buckets of every held epoch for today and yesterday; units that cannot be processed yet (unknown epoch or generation, sender not yet reachable) are held and retried. A sender rotates before its first send, when its chain is due, and whenever a member it has not yet keyed becomes reachable. Group mailboxes are created by their first write; the write token is the mailbox's owner secret, so every member can write and read (`FLAG_GROUP`).
8. **Not implemented yet:** the pre-rekey `ForcePQStep` (§5.2), adding members after creation, On-the-record signatures, polls, invite links and join requests, hosting moves, own-device sync, and the group UI.

## Open questions

1. Own-device messages are not covered by the MAC vector (§3). The fix chosen here (confirm through own-device sync) delays display of one's own messages sent from another device by up to 60 s. An alternative is to reserve one MAC-vector entry for the sender's own account, which requires 100 entries (1,600 B) and changes the group envelope budget.
2. In Off-the-record groups PLAN §7 says poll closes are "signed by the poll's creator". A signature would make the creator's poll results non-deniable, so this spec uses the MAC vector there and a signature only in On-the-record groups.
3. Resolved in M7: the exporter uses the PQ root history, which is already retained (implementation note 2). The formal model must still confirm it.
4. Group-scoped request capabilities (§9) are a new object not named in PLAN; they let a joiner reach members without PoW. Their abuse limits (per group, per day) need to be set.
