# Cover-Traffic Data Rates and Latency

Status: Draft (M0, reconciled with the M4 scheduler code) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §9.4, §9.5, honest limit 5, Appendix A; `crates/enclave-net/src/schedule.rs`. This document derives the data rates and latencies quoted in `09-transport.md` §6 and in the UI from first principles. Every figure here is an estimate until M4 measures `k`, `u`, SURB size, and overheads; M4 must land within ±20%.

## 1. Tick model as implemented

`enclave_net::schedule::Scheduler` produces one tick at a time:

| Profile | Tick delay | Poll target |
|---|---|---|
| Foreground | fixed 3 s | account inbox on even ticks; other mailboxes on odd ticks by smooth weighted round robin; inbox on every tick if there are no other mailboxes |
| Background | exponential, mean 120 s (Poisson process) | same as Foreground |
| Maximum | fixed 3 s | same as Foreground |

Each tick sends one 16,384 B unit (real or cover) and one 2,048 B poll. Bulk bursts are allowed in Foreground and Background and disabled in Maximum.

**Replies.** The server answers every request with a 16,384 B reply unit, and the transports implemented so far (`TcpTransport`, `TorTransport`) return it. PLAN §9.4 counts **one** unit down per tick: writes and cover units get no reply over the mixnet. The data figures in §3 to §5 follow PLAN's model, which requires the Nym transport to send writes and cover units without reply SURBs. That is where the implementation must change; §2.1 gives the figures if it does not.

## 2. Assumptions

| Symbol | Meaning | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S` | Sphinx packet size on the wire (Nym) | 2,413 B | V (Nym docs) |
| `P` | Sphinx payload size | 2,048 B | V (Nym docs) |
| `u` | Usable Enclave bytes per Sphinx packet after Nym's message framing | unknown, `u < P` | U, measured in M1.5/M4 |
| `U` | Wire unit size | 16,384 B | fixed (D1) |
| `k` | Sphinx packets per wire unit, `k = ⌈U / u⌉` | 9 to 11 (PLAN) | U |
| `p` | Sphinx packets per poll object (2,048 B plus its reply SURBs) | 1 or 2 (PLAN) | U |
| `T_fg` | Foreground and Maximum tick | 3 s | fixed (`Profile::mean_tick`) |
| `T_bg` | Background tick mean (Poisson) | 120 s | fixed |
| `λ_loop` | Nym loop-cover rate | 1 per 10 s (Foreground, Maximum); 1 per tick (Background) | specified, not implemented |
| `o` | Tor + TLS + TCP/IP + WSS overhead factor on client bytes | ≈1.10 | estimated (§2.2) |

Relationship between `u` and `k` (`k = ⌈16,384 / u⌉`):

| `k` | Range of `u` (B) |
|---|---|
| 8 | 2,048 (only if Nym framing were zero) |
| 9 | 1,821 to 2,047 |
| 10 | 1,639 to 1,820 |
| 11 | 1,490 to 1,638 |

### 2.1 Bytes per tick

PLAN's model (1 unit up, 1 poll up, 1 reply down):

```
packets per tick  = k (unit up) + p (poll up) + k (poll reply down) = 2k + p
```

As implemented today (a reply for the write or cover unit too):

```
packets per tick  = k + p + k + k (write reply down) = 3k + p
```

| `k` | `p` | PLAN model: packets | Sphinx bytes/tick | Implemented: packets | Sphinx bytes/tick |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | 1 | 19 | 45,847 | 28 | 67,564 |
| 9 | 2 | 20 | 48,260 | 29 | 69,977 |
| 10 | 1 | 21 | 50,673 | 31 | 74,803 |
| 10 | 2 | 22 | 53,086 | 32 | 77,216 |
| 11 | 1 | 23 | 55,499 | 34 | 82,042 |
| 11 | 2 | 24 | 57,912 | 35 | 84,455 |

With a reply for every request, the rates in §3 to §5 grow by a factor of `(3k + p) / (2k + p)` ≈ 1.46 to 1.47 before loop cover: Foreground ≈91–104 MB/h, Background ≈57–65 MB/day, Maximum ≈2.2–2.5 GB/day (with loop cover and `o` = 1.10, `k` = 9 to 10). That is outside PLAN's ±20% band, so the M4 gate cannot pass without dropping write replies.

Loop cover: each loop packet goes up and comes back down, so it costs 2 × 2,413 = 4,826 B.

### 2.2 Overhead factor `o`

- Tor carries data in 514 B cells with 498 B of relay payload. One 2,413 B Sphinx packet needs ⌈2,413 / 498⌉ = 5 cells = 2,570 B, a factor of 2,570 / 2,413 = **1.065**.
- TLS records, TCP/IP headers (about 52 B per 1,448 B segment), and WSS framing add about **3 to 4%**.
- Combined: 1.065 × 1.035 ≈ **1.10**. M4 measures it.

## 3. Foreground (tick 3 s, PLAN model)

```
ticks per hour = 3,600 / 3 = 1,200
loop per hour  = 3,600 / 10 = 360 → 360 × 4,826 = 1,737,360 B ≈ 1.74 MB
data per hour  = o × (1,200 × bytes/tick + 1.74 MB)
```

| `k`, `p` | Sphinx only | + loop | × 1.10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9, 1 | 55.0 MB | 56.8 MB | 62.4 MB/h |
| 9, 2 | 57.9 MB | 59.7 MB | 65.6 MB/h |
| 10, 1 | 60.8 MB | 62.5 MB | 68.8 MB/h |
| 10, 2 | 63.7 MB | 65.4 MB | 72.0 MB/h |
| 11, 2 | 69.5 MB | 71.2 MB | 78.4 MB/h |

PLAN's **≈60–70 MB/h** matches `k` = 9 to 10 with overhead. At `k` = 11, `p` = 2 the figure is ≈78 MB/h: above PLAN's range, but inside the ±20% M4 tolerance (70 × 1.2 = 84 MB/h).

## 4. Background (Poisson, mean 120 s, PLAN model)

```
ticks per day = 86,400 / 120 = 720
loop per day  = 720 × 4,826 = 3,474,720 B ≈ 3.47 MB     (1 per tick)
data per day  = o × (720 × bytes/tick + 3.47 MB)
```

| `k`, `p` | Sphinx only | + loop (1 per tick) | × 1.10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9, 1 | 33.0 MB | 36.5 MB | 40.1 MB/day |
| 9, 2 | 34.7 MB | 38.2 MB | 42.0 MB/day |
| 10, 1 | 36.5 MB | 40.0 MB | 44.0 MB/day |
| 10, 2 | 38.2 MB | 41.7 MB | 45.9 MB/day |

PLAN's **≈35–40 MB/day** matches the Sphinx-only figures for `k` = 9 to 10 and is about 10 to 15% low once Tor overhead is included, which is inside the ±20% M4 band.

**Why loop cover is 1 per tick in Background.** At PLAN's 1 per 10 s, loop cover alone would be 8,640 × 4,826 B = 41.7 MB/day, more than the whole Background budget (`00-overview.md` §9, I-10).

## 5. Maximum privacy (tick 3 s always, PLAN model)

```
ticks per day = 86,400 / 3 = 28,800
loop per day  = 8,640 × 4,826 = 41.7 MB
```

| `k`, `p` | Sphinx only | + loop | × 1.10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9, 1 | 1.320 GB | 1.362 GB | 1.50 GB/day |
| 9, 2 | 1.390 GB | 1.432 GB | 1.57 GB/day |
| 10, 1 | 1.459 GB | 1.501 GB | 1.65 GB/day |
| 10, 2 | 1.529 GB | 1.571 GB | 1.73 GB/day |

PLAN's **≈1.5–1.7 GB/day** matches. The UI states "about 1.5 GB a day".

## 6. Bulk mode and media

Bulk (`Scheduler::bulk`, Foreground and Background only) sends queued requests in a burst. At PLAN's cap of 40 Sphinx packets per second (a transport limit, not implemented yet), each chunk is one wire unit of `k` packets:

```
time for a blob = n_B × k / 40 s
```

| Object | Chunks `n_B` | `k` = 9 | `k` = 10 | `k` = 11 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Photo, 1 MiB bucket | 74 | 16.7 s | 18.5 s | 20.4 s |
| Photo, 4 MiB bucket | 295 | 66.4 s | 73.8 s | 81.1 s |
| Vault-key object (98 directory chunks in the reference client) | 98 | 22.1 s | 24.5 s | 27.0 s |
| Contact add, 5 devices (`math/envelope-budget.md` §9) | 112 | 25.2 s | 28.0 s | 30.8 s |

PLAN's "Photo ~16 s" matches the 1 MiB bucket at `k` = 9. Bulk payload throughput: 40 × `u` ≤ 40 × 2,048 = 81,920 B/s ≈ **82 KB/s**, which is why the M4 "≥200 KB/s" gate measures nym-sdk raw throughput (`00-overview.md` §9, I-12).

**Maximum mode.** `bulk` returns nothing, so each chunk takes the up slot of one 3 s tick:

| Bucket | Chunks | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 1 MiB | 74 | 222 s ≈ 3.7 min |
| 4 MiB | 295 | 885 s ≈ 14.8 min |

PLAN's "a 1 MiB photo takes about 15 minutes" corresponds to the 4 MiB bucket (a photo just over 1 MiB); a photo that fits the 1 MiB bucket takes about 3.7 minutes (`00-overview.md` §9, I-11).

## 7. Latency

### 7.1 Model

Median one-way text latency, sender in Foreground:

```
L = W_send + D_write + W_poll + D_poll_reply
W_send        wait for the sender's next up slot: uniform on [0, 3 s] → median 1.5 s
D_write       Tor (≈0.2–0.4 s) + Nym (3 mix hops at Nym's default mean delay plus link latency,
              ≈0.5–0.8 s) + exit gateway to server ≈ 1.0–1.5 s
W_poll        wait until the recipient's next inbox poll reaches the server:
              inbox polled every tick (no other mailboxes) → median T/2;
              inbox polled on even ticks (other mailboxes present) → median T in Foreground
D_poll_reply  the poll's reply over SURBs ≈ 1.0–1.5 s
```

### 7.2 Results

| Case (recipient's scheduler) | `W_send` | `D_write` | `W_poll` | `D_poll_reply` | Median `L` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foreground or Maximum, inbox only | 1.5 | 1.0–1.5 | 1.5 | 1.0–1.5 | **5.0–6.0 s** |
| Foreground or Maximum, other mailboxes present | 1.5 | 1.0–1.5 | 3.0 | 1.0–1.5 | **6.5–7.5 s** |
| Background, inbox only (no push) | 1.5 | 1.0–1.5 | 83.8 (§7.3) | 1.0–1.5 | **≈88 s** |
| Background, other mailboxes present (no push) | 1.5 | 1.0–1.5 | 136.2 (§7.3) | 1.0–1.5 | **≈140 s** |

PLAN's "≈5–6 s" holds when the inbox is polled every tick. With other mailboxes in the rotation the median rises by about 1.5 s (`00-overview.md` §9, I-9).

### 7.3 Background poll wait (simulated)

Background ticks are a Poisson process with mean 120 s, so the wait from a message's arrival to the next inbox poll is not uniform. A simulation of 200,000 arrivals over 3 × 10⁷ s of ticks gives:

| Inbox polled on | Median wait | P(wait ≤ 115 s) | Median `L` (sender in Foreground) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Every tick | 83.8 s | 61.5% | ≈88 s | implemented when the inbox is the only mailbox |
| 3 of every 4 ticks | 107.7 s | 52.3% | ≈112 s | proposed in the M0 draft; not implemented |
| Every other tick | 136.2 s | 43.6% | ≈140 s | implemented when other mailboxes are present |

PLAN's "≤2 min" in Background holds for the median only if the inbox is polled on at least 3 of every 4 Background ticks. The implemented scheduler alternates strictly in every profile, so with other mailboxes present the Background median is ≈140 s. Either the scheduler changes (the 1-in-4 pattern keeps exactly one poll per tick, so the traffic shape is unchanged), or PLAN's Background latency figure changes (`09-transport.md` Open questions).

## 8. Server-side scale

See `12-servers.md` §7: 100k accounts with 5% of 150,000 devices in Foreground give ≈483 Mbit/s of reply egress under PLAN's one-reply-per-tick model (twice that if every write also gets a reply unit), and ≈7,375 sealed requests per second (≈2.2 cores at 0.3 ms each).

## 9. What M4 must measure

1. `u` and therefore `k` on each platform's nym-sdk build.
2. SURB size and therefore `p`.
3. The overhead factor `o` on real Tor circuits.
4. Nym per-hop delay distribution at default settings, and link latencies.
5. Battery cost per profile.

If any measured data rate falls outside ±20% of §3 to §5, the tick length is adjusted **globally** (never per user; D10) through an RFC.

## Open questions

1. The Nym SURB size is not known; if a reply of `k` packets needs `k` SURBs of several hundred bytes each, a poll may need 3 or more packets rather than PLAN's 1 to 2, raising every figure above by about 2 to 4%.
2. Whether Nym loop cover returning to the client counts toward the downlink budget in the same way on all platforms (it does in this model).
3. Every request gets a reply unit in the implemented transports (§1, §2.1). Meeting PLAN's data budget requires sending writes and cover units without reply SURBs. Dropping those replies also removes the only delivery status a sender gets for a write; delivery would then be confirmed by receipts only.
4. The Background median latency with other mailboxes present is ≈140 s as implemented (§7.3), above PLAN's "≤2 min".
