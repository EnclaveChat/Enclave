# Design System: "Paper & Seal"

Status: Draft (M0) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §15. Tokens: `design/tokens.toml` (source of truth), generated into `tokens.slint` by `enclave-design`. Copy glossary: `design/copy-glossary.md`. Accessibility: `18-a11y-i18n.md`.

## 1. Point of view

Enclave feels like private correspondence done well: warm paper, deep pine ink, and one saffron seal that appears only when something has really been confirmed.

Three rules follow from this and override any local design choice:

1. **Saffron means "confirmed by you".** It is never used for decoration, branding, warnings, or calls to action.
2. **"Private" is the default and is never labelled.** Only exceptions are shown.
3. **Security events are inline and persistent.** They are never toasts, never red-only, never hidden behind icons.

## 2. Typefaces and type scale

### 2.1 Faces

Two families, both SIL OFL 1.1, bundled unmodified with `OFL.txt` in `LICENSES/`.

| Face | Weights | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **Atkinson Hyperlegible Next** | 400, 600 only | Everything people read: messages, UI, headings. Built for low-vision legibility. |
| **Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono** | 400 | Only things people must **compare or copy exactly**: security codes, recovery words, link and invite codes. Its 0/O and 1/l/I glyphs are clearly different. |

Content fonts (not design choices): Noto Color Emoji for emoji; Noto Sans, bundled per shipped locale, for scripts Atkinson does not cover.

### 2.2 Scale (sp on Android, pt on Apple, logical px on desktop)

| Token | Size | Weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type.caption` | 13 | 400 | Timestamps, footnotes, bubble metadata |
| `type.secondary` | 15 | 400 | Secondary lines, list subtitles |
| `type.body` | **17** | 400 | **Body text and messages** |
| `type.title` | 20 | 600 | Section titles, dialog titles |
| `type.screen_title` | 24 | 600 | Screen titles |
| `type.onboarding` | 32 | 600 | Onboarding only |
| `type.mono_code` | 22 | 400 (Mono) | Security codes, recovery words, link codes; tracking 0.04 em |

- Line height: 1.4 for all text.
- OS text scaling is honored up to **200%** with **no truncation of message text**. Layouts reflow; bubbles grow; lists wrap.
- Numbers in security codes are grouped in fives with a thin space; screen readers read one group at a time.

## 3. Palette

One dominant color (Pine), one accent (Saffron), and neutrals. Contrast ratios follow WCAG 2.x and are checked in CI by `cargo xtask tokens-check`. Every ratio below was computed with the WCAG relative-luminance formula.

### 3.1 Tokens

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `background` | Paper `#F6F3EC` | Night `#111412` | App background |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1A1E1B` | Sheets, dialogs |
| `bubble_in` | `#ECE7DC` | `#242A26` | Incoming bubble |
| `bubble_out` | `#DCEBE6` | `#2A6B58` | Outgoing bubble |
| `text` | Ink `#1C1F1D` | Chalk `#EEEAE1` | Primary text |
| `text_muted` | `#585E59` | `#A7ADA6` | Secondary text; input borders |
| `pine` (dominant) | `#1D5646` | `#7CC4A8` | Primary buttons, links, focus (light) |
| `saffron` (accent) | `#F2B230`, **fill only** | `#F5BE45` | **Fixed meaning: "confirmed by you"** |
| `danger` | Brick `#A8321E` | Ember `#F08A73` | Danger only; always with an icon and text |
| `hairline` | `#CFC8BA` | `#3A423D` | Decorative dividers only |

Derived tokens (also in `design/tokens.toml`):

| Token | Light | Dark | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `on_pine` | Paper `#F6F3EC` | Night `#111412` | Text on Pine buttons |
| `on_saffron` | Ink `#1C1F1D` | Night `#111412` | Text or stroke on a Saffron fill |
| `focus_ring` | Pine `#1D5646` | Saffron `#F5BE45` | 2 px focus ring (`18-a11y-i18n.md`) |
| `on_bubble_out` | Ink `#1C1F1D` | Chalk `#EEEAE1` | All text on outgoing bubbles |
| `meta_on_bubble_out` | `#585E59` | Chalk `#EEEAE1` | Timestamps and status on outgoing bubbles (§3.3) |
| `link_on_bubble_out` | Pine `#1D5646` | Chalk `#EEEAE1`, underlined | Links on outgoing bubbles (§3.3) |
| `seal_stroke` | Pine `#1D5646` | Night `#111412` | Stroke around the Seal glyph |

The PLAN §15.2 figures (15.0 / 15.44, 13.51, 5.23, 6.0, 5.39, 7.67, 9.11, 8.86, 1.69, 6.04 / 7.58) all reproduce exactly. The two failures in bold are pairs PLAN did not list; the derived tokens above resolve them without changing the palette.

### 3.3 Usage rules

- **Proportions:** about 85% neutrals, 12% Pine, under 3% Saffron.
- **No gradients**, anywhere.
- **Color is never the only way state is shown.** Every state has a shape and words (§6.5).
- In **light mode**, Saffron is a **fill only** and always carries a Pine or Ink stroke of at least 1.5 px so the glyph reaches 3:1.
- In **dark mode**, all text and links on the outgoing bubble use Chalk; links are underlined.
- `danger` is used only for destructive actions and genuine errors, always paired with an icon and text. A changed security code is **not** danger (§6.4).
- `hairline` is never used for input borders or any information-bearing line.

## 4. Spacing, grid, shape, elevation

| Token group | Values |
|---|---|
| Spacing (4-pt base) | 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 |
| Grid, phone | 4 columns, 16 margin, 8 gutter |
| Grid, tablet | 8 columns, 24 margin, 16 gutter |
| Grid, desktop | 320 conversation list; fluid conversation with 680 max text width; 360 details pane |
| Touch targets | At least 48 × 48 dp |
| Radii | 8 controls; 12 bubbles (4 on the tail corner); 20 sheets |
| Elevation | Two levels only: `flat` (0) and `raised` (sheets and menus) |

## 5. Motion, haptics, icons

- **Motion:** 150 to 200 ms, ease-out. **Reduce-motion** turns every animation into a cross-fade (and the Seal close into an instant state change).
- **Haptics:** a light tick on send; a distinct pattern when the Seal closes. Haptics follow the OS setting.
- **Icons:** a custom 24 px set with a 1.75 px stroke, derived from Lucide (ISC). **No locks, shields, or keyholes.**
- **App icon:** a Pine square with a paper-colored Seal (a circle with a folded notch).
- **Spinners:** never longer than 2 s without text. Progress bars show real progress only.

## 6. Signature moments

### 6.1 Onboarding: no phone number, under 60 s

1. "Talk privately. No phone number. No email." **[Get started]**
2. "What should people call you?" (name, optional photo) with the line "Only people you talk to can see this." While the user types, keys are generated and the proof-of-work runs behind a single line: "Setting up your private address…"
3. A server is picked automatically: "Your messages wait here, locked, until your devices collect them. **Change**"
4. The home screen shows three equal actions: **Show my code**, **Scan a code**, **Share an invite link**. Usernames come later, with one honest line: "A username is public, like an email address."
5. **Recovery words** are deferred until after the first conversation or 24 hours.
   - They appear as a persistent card: 24 numbered words in Mono, a check of 3 words, "Save as file" on desktop, and screenshot blocking on Android.
   - The words must be saved before linking a device or claiming a username.
   - Completing this earns the Saffron seal on Settings → Account.

### 6.2 Meeting in person is verification

- Two people scan each other's codes. The **Seal closes**: two halves meet in 240 ms (instant under reduce-motion) with a haptic pulse.
- Three matching Seal words appear on both phones.
- "You and Sam are checked in person. If anything changes, we'll tell you before you send anything."
- The contact header gains a small Saffron seal and the date.

### 6.3 Checking remotely

- Title: "Check it's really Sam."
- Twelve groups of 5 digits in Mono, or 10 words to read aloud on a call.
- Screen readers read one group at a time.
- The user taps **They match**.

### 6.4 Security code changed

An in-conversation card with a Saffron left rule and **no red**:

> Sam's security code changed. This usually means a new phone or a reinstall. Check again before sharing anything private.

Buttons: **Check now** and **Later**. The first send after a change needs a tap-through. If "Only send to checked contacts" is on, sending is blocked.

### 6.5 Security state without jargon

- "Private" is the default and is never labelled; only exceptions show.
- Contact state has three shapes plus words: a filled Seal for "Checked in person", an outline for "Not checked yet", and a notched Seal for "Code changed".
- The mode chip reads **"Off the record"**: "Nobody can prove to others who wrote these messages." Or **"On the record"**: "Your messages carry your signature. Anyone who gets a copy can prove you wrote them."
- Delivery shapes: hollow dot "Sending privately…", half dot "On its way" (sent one way), full dot "Delivered" (the recipient's receipt came), ring "Read", and a hollow dot in the warning color "Not delivered yet" (no receipt after every re-send, `09-transport.md` §6.1). The first time only: "Private delivery takes a few seconds. That pause is part of what hides who you talk to."
- The pre-call sheet offers **"Private route (hides where you are)"** or **"Direct (clearer, but Sam can see your internet address)"**.
- Settings → Privacy: "Standard" or "Maximum (hides even when you're using Enclave; uses about 1.5 GB a day)". On iPhone it adds: "iPhone pauses apps in the background, so Maximum only works while Enclave is open."
- "Extra protection: finishing…" (the McEliece braid) and "Backup route" appear only on the contact-info and settings screens.

### 6.6 Wrong-place link code

"This code links a device to your account. Only scan it from Settings → Your devices, on your own new device. No one from Enclave will ever ask you to scan one."

### 6.7 Contact art

Contact art is key-derived (`art_seed`, `02b-key-schedule.md` §4.3) so that a lookalike account looks different (RT-26).

- A 5 × 5 grid, mirrored left to right, on a circle clipped to the avatar size. Each cell is filled or empty from the seed's bits; the fill color is one of 8 Pine and neutral tints chosen from the seed. Saffron is never used.
- Art is shown only when the contact has no photo, and next to the name in the security-code screen.
- It is decorative for screen readers (the name is the label) and never the only identifier.

## 7. Copy voice

- A calm, exact friend who has done this before.
- Second person, sentence case, one idea per sentence.
- Say what happened, what it means, and what to do.
- Use concrete numbers ("about 60 MB an hour"). Never fear, never brag, never blame.
- Aim for a grade 6 to 8 reading level.
- **Keys and algorithms appear only in an "Advanced details" sheet.**
- Example error: "Couldn't send yet. Your phone is offline. We'll send it when you're back."
- Glossary and banned words: `design/copy-glossary.md`.

## 8. Banned

**Visuals:**

- purple-to-blue gradients, or any gradients;
- glassmorphism or frosted blur;
- emoji used as UI decoration;
- identical icon-card grids;
- padlocks, shields, keyholes, vault doors, hooded hackers, binary rain, terminal green, or skeuomorphic wax seals with shadows;
- confetti, stock photos of people, 3D blobs;
- more than two elevation levels;
- red or green as the only signal;
- toasts for security events (they must be inline and persistent);
- spinners over 2 s without text;
- fake progress.

**Copy:** "unlock", "seamless", "elevate", "empower", "supercharge", "military-grade", "bank-level", "unbreakable", "bulletproof", "hacker-proof", "100% secure", "anonymous" as a promise, "Oops", and exclamation marks in system copy.

**Behaviour:** dark patterns in privacy or data settings (pre-checked data sharing, confirm-shaming, hidden "off" options, nagging to disable Maximum privacy).

## 9. Token pipeline

- `design/tokens.toml` is the single source. `enclave-design` generates `tokens.slint` (Slint globals) at build time.
- `cargo xtask tokens-check` computes every pair in §3.2 from the TOML and fails if any "yes" pair drops below its requirement, or if a new text/background token pair is added without a row.
- CI also runs a copy lint over all `@tr()` source strings for the banned-copy list.

## Open questions

1. The two dark-mode failures (§3.2) are resolved with derived tokens. An alternative is to darken the dark `bubble_out` so that Pine-light and muted text pass; that would change PLAN's palette value `#2A6B58`.
2. The copy lint (§9) must allow "unlock" in OS-mandated contexts (for example, "Unlock your phone to continue" is the OS's wording, not Enclave's). This spec bans it in Enclave's own strings only.
3. Contact art (§6.7) is a proposal; it must be tested for distinctness (lookalike roots produce visibly different art) and for color-vision deficiencies.
