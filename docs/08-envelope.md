# Wire Units and Envelopes

Status: Draft (M0, reconciled with the M1–M3 code) · Normative

Source: PLAN.md §8 (D1). Crates: `enclave-wire` (sizes, unit and poll framing, content padding), `enclave-rpc` (sealing, API payloads), `enclave-proto` `envelope.rs` (direct and request envelopes). Arithmetic: `math/envelope-budget.md`. Cryptography: `02-cryptography.md` §4 (EnclaveSeal overhead is 64 B: `N` 32 ‖ … ‖ `T` 32).

Every table below gives offsets in bytes from the start of the object. Every table sums exactly, and the sum is shown under it. `enclave-wire` asserts the main sizes at compile time (§10). Where this document and the code disagree, the code is normative.

## 1. Conventions

- All objects that cross the network or sit on a server have fixed sizes.
- "Random" regions are filled from the hedged RNG (`02-cryptography.md` §6). "Zero" regions are zero on send; where the table says "checked", the receiver rejects non-zero bytes.
- The plaintext length of content is carried only inside a seal (an 8 B `u64` in content framing, §5.5, or a 4 B `u32` in API framing, §2.3).

| Object | Size | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Wire unit (request) | 16,384 | Every request with a payload |
| Reply unit | 16,384 | Every reply, including replies to polls and to undecryptable requests |
| Poll object | 2,048 | Header-only requests (`Poll`, `Ack` in the reference client) |
| Envelope region | 14,336 | Inside every wire unit and reply unit: a stored envelope, a blob chunk, or an API payload |

## 2. Wire unit (request): 16,384 B

| Offset | Length | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | version | `u16` = 1 |
| 2 | 2 | suite | `u16` = 1 (`SUITE_V1`) |
| 4 | 56 | X448 ephemeral public key | server seal |
| 60 | 1,568 | ML-KEM-1024 ciphertext | server seal, to the server's daily key |
| 1,628 | 32 | seal nonce `N` | |
| 1,660 | 72 | request header (encrypted) | §2.1 |
| 1,732 | 14,336 | envelope region (encrypted) | §5 to §9, or an API payload (§2.3) |
| 16,068 | 32 | seal tag `T` | |
| 16,100 | 284 | random padding | outside the seal |

Sum: 2 + 2 + 56 + 1,568 + 32 + 72 + 14,336 + 32 + 284 = **16,384**.

Grouped: prefix 4 + server KEM 1,624 + sealed region 14,472 (`N` 32 + header 72 + envelope 14,336 + `T` 32) + padding 284 = 16,384.

The sealed region is `seal(k_req, u32(key_id), header ‖ envelope)` with `k_req` from `09-transport.md` §2. The daily key ID is not on the wire; it is the associated data, so the server tries each key it holds (newest first). The seal plaintext is 72 + 14,336 = 14,408 B.

Compared with PLAN §8 (4 + 1,624 + 72 seal overhead + 64 header + 14,336 + 284), the implementation has a 64 B seal overhead (no 8 B framing header) and a 72 B request header. The total and the 284 B padding are PLAN's.

### 2.1 Request header: 72 B

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `op` (§2.2) |
| 1 | 1 | `flags` (op-specific) |
| 2 | 6 | reserved (zero, checked) |
| 8 | 32 | mailbox, object ID, or random |
| 40 | 32 | token, credential, proof, or random (op-specific) |

Sum: 1 + 1 + 6 + 32 + 32 = **72**.

`RequestHeader::decode` rejects a wrong length, non-zero reserved bytes, and an unknown `op`. The same 72 B layout is used for the reply header (§3.1).

### 2.2 Operations

| Op | Name | Object | Mailbox field | Token field | Envelope region | Reply |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Cover` | unit | random | random | random | `Ok`, empty; the server drops the request after authenticating the seal |
| 1 | `Write` | unit | account-inbox address | single-use write token | stored envelope (§5), stored as is | status only |
| 2 | `WriteRequest` | unit | request-inbox address | proof of work (`nonce 16 ‖ solution 16`) | request envelope (§6), stored as is | status only |
| 3 | `Poll` | poll | inbox address | read credential (24) ‖ `u64` cursor | — | one stored envelope, or empty |
| 4 | `Ack` | poll | inbox address | read credential (24) ‖ `u64` watermark | — | status only |
| 5 | `BlobPut` | unit | chunk ID | proof of work | blob chunk (§9), stored as is | status only |
| 6 | `BlobGet` | unit or poll | chunk ID | unused | — | the chunk |
| 7 | `Directory` | unit | unused (zero) | unused (zero) | API payload: `DirRequest` (§9.3) | API payload: `DirReply` |
| 8 | `RegisterTokens` | unit | inbox address | owner secret | API payload: concatenated 32 B token hashes (ignored on create) | status only |
| 9 | `KeyTransparency` | — | — | — | — | not implemented: always `NotFound` |

`flags` for `RegisterTokens`: bit 0 (`0x01`) `CREATE` creates the inbox; bit 1 (`0x02`) `REQUEST_INBOX` makes the new inbox a request inbox. Other ops ignore `flags`.

The server accepts any op in either object size; a poll object has an empty envelope region. The reference client (`enclave-sim`) sends `Poll` and `Ack` as poll objects and every other op as a unit. Server semantics are in `12-servers.md` §1.

### 2.3 API framing

Ops whose envelope region carries a control payload use:

```
frame(payload) = u32(len(payload)) ‖ payload ‖ random padding         # exactly 14,336 B
```

`MAX_PAYLOAD` = 14,336 − 4 = 14,332 B. `unframe` rejects a region that is not 14,336 B or whose length field points past the end. (This `frame` is `enclave_rpc::api::frame`; it is unrelated to the KMAC framing of `02-cryptography.md` §2.3.)

## 3. Reply unit: 16,384 B

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 32 | seal nonce `N` |
| 32 | 72 | reply header (encrypted, §3.1) |
| 104 | 14,336 | reply envelope region (encrypted) |
| 14,440 | 32 | seal tag `T` |
| 14,472 | 1,912 | random padding |

Sum: 32 + 72 + 14,336 + 32 + 1,912 = **16,384**.

The sealed region is `seal(k_reply, "reply", header ‖ envelope)` (AD is the 5 ASCII bytes `reply`), written at offset 0. A reply unit has no cleartext version, suite or KEM fields, so it looks uniformly random. A request the server cannot open (wrong size, unknown version or suite, no key opens it, bad header) gets 16,384 random bytes instead; the client's `open_reply` fails and it treats the request as failed.

### 3.1 Reply header: 72 B

Same layout as §2.1:

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `op` of the request, echoed |
| 1 | 1 | `flags`: status in bits 0–3; `FOUND` (`0x10`) a poll returned an envelope; `MORE` (`0x20`) more envelopes follow it |
| 2 | 6 | reserved (zero) |
| 8 | 32 | mailbox of the request, echoed |
| 40 | 32 | op-specific: for a `Poll` that found an envelope, `0^24 ‖ u64(sequence number)`; otherwise zero |

Sum: 1 + 1 + 6 + 32 + 32 = **72**.

Status codes (`enclave_rpc::api::Status`):

| Value | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `Ok` | Success (including "nothing to return") |
| 1 | `Denied` | Bad or spent token, bad credential, inbox exists, wrong inbox type |
| 2 | `NotFound` | No such inbox, object, chunk, or claim |
| 3 | `Quota` | Inbox or token quota exceeded |
| 4 | `Malformed` | Malformed payload (also used for unknown status values when parsing) |
| 5 | `Pow` | Proof of work missing or too weak |
| 6 | `Invalid` | Stored object failed validation (bad signature, rollback, wrong key) |

Reply envelope region: for a `Poll` that found an envelope and for `BlobGet`, the stored bytes exactly as written; for every other reply, an API frame (§2.3) holding a `DirReply` or an empty payload.

## 4. Poll object: 2,048 B

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | version (`u16` = 1) |
| 2 | 2 | suite (`u16` = 1) |
| 4 | 56 | X448 ephemeral public key |
| 60 | 1,568 | ML-KEM-1024 ciphertext |
| 1,628 | 32 | seal nonce `N` |
| 1,660 | 72 | request header (encrypted) |
| 1,732 | 32 | seal tag `T` |
| 1,764 | 284 | random padding |

Sum: 2 + 2 + 56 + 1,568 + 32 + 72 + 32 + 284 = **2,048**.

The sealed region is 136 B: `seal(k_req, u32(key_id), header)`. The poll object is exactly the wire unit without its 14,336 B envelope region (16,384 − 14,336 = 2,048), with the same 1,628 B prefix and 284 B padding. It carries **exactly one mailbox** (D7). The reply to a poll is a full reply unit (§3). Whether a poll object plus its Nym reply SURBs fits in one or two Sphinx packets is measured in M4 (`math/cover-traffic.md` §2).

## 5. Direct stored envelope: 14,336 B

A direct envelope carries one message to up to five devices of one account (`06-multidevice.md`). Built by `envelope::seal_direct`, opened by `envelope::open_direct`.

### 5.1 Layout

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | version = 1 |
| 1 | 1 | kind = 1 (`Direct`) |
| 2 | 14 | zero |
| 16 | 800 | device-slot table: 5 × 160 (§5.2), shuffled |
| 816 | 3,264 | PQ slot (§5.3) |
| 4,080 | 1,024 | notification capsule (§5.4): random |
| 5,104 | 32 | body `N` |
| 5,136 | 8 | content length `u64` (encrypted) |
| 5,144 | 9,160 | content and random padding (encrypted) |
| 14,304 | 32 | body `T` |

Sum: 16 + 800 + 3,264 + 1,024 + 32 + 8 + 9,160 + 32 = **14,336**.

Grouped as in PLAN §8: header 16, device slots 800, PQ slot 3,264, capsule 1,024, body overhead 72 (seal 64 + length 8), content 9,160. The offsets are `enclave_wire::direct::{SLOTS = 16, PQ = 816, CAPSULE = 4,080, BODY = 5,104}` and `CONTENT_CAPACITY = 9,160`.

The first 16 B (`hdr16`) are the only cleartext besides random-looking slots. They are the associated data of every seal in the envelope. Envelope kinds (`enclave_wire::EnvelopeKind`): 1 `Direct`, 2 `Group`, 3 `Blob`, 4 `Cover`, 5 `Request`. Only `Direct` and `Request` envelopes are built by the code today. `open_direct` checks the length, the version and the kind; the 14 zero bytes are not checked but are bound by every seal's AD.

### 5.2 Device slot: 160 B

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 16 | lookup tag (`05-ratchet.md` §6) |
| 16 | 112 | compact-sealed slot header (ciphertext) |
| 128 | 32 | compact-seal tag |

Sum: 16 + 112 + 32 = **160**.

The slot header plaintext (112 B) is in `05-ratchet.md` §6.1. It is sealed with `seal_compact(HKs, tag ‖ SHA3-512(sealed body), hdr16, header)`. Unused slots are 160 random bytes. The five slots are shuffled (Fisher-Yates with hedged randomness) so that position carries no information.

### 5.3 PQ slot: 3,264 B

| Offset (in slot) | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 3,232 | compact-sealed PQ plaintext (ciphertext) |
| 3,232 | 32 | compact-seal tag |

Sum: 3,232 + 32 = **3,264**. The plaintext (3,232 B, zero-padded) is in `05-ratchet.md` §8.1. Key: `KMAC256(mk_DR, "", 256, "enclave/v1/ratchet/pq-slot")` of the carrying session; nonce material and AD as for that session's device slot. When no session carries the PQ slot, it is 3,264 random bytes.

### 5.4 Notification capsule: 1,024 B

Always 1,024 random bytes. Sealed notification previews (`10-push.md` §4) are not implemented; when they are, the capsule keeps this offset and size.

### 5.5 Body and content framing

```
body_key = HedgedRng.fill("envelope/body-key", 32)            # fresh per envelope
framed   = u64(len(content)) ‖ content ‖ random padding      # exactly 8 + 9,160 = 9,168 B
body     = seal(body_key, hdr16, framed)                      # 9,168 + 64 = 9,232 B
```

`pad_content` rejects content over the capacity; `unpad_content` rejects a length field larger than the region. The body key reaches each recipient device wrapped in its device slot (`05-ratchet.md` §5).

Content is opaque bytes at this layer. Not implemented yet: the Protobuf content schema, continuation units for content over one envelope, receipts and KT gossip riding in the content, and On-the-record signatures (which would take 4,741 B of the 9,160, leaving 4,419).

## 6. Request envelope: 14,336 B

A request envelope carries an EQXDH initial message plus the first message to one device (`04-eqxdh.md`). Built by `envelope::seal_request`, parsed by `envelope::request_initial` and opened by `envelope::open_request`.

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | version = 1 |
| 1 | 1 | kind = 5 (`Request`) |
| 2 | 14 | zero |
| 16 | 8,537 | initial-message block (`INITIAL_BLOCK_LEN`, §6.1) |
| 8,553 | 16 | lookup tag |
| 8,569 | 144 | compact-sealed slot header (112 + 32) |
| 8,713 | 32 | body `N` |
| 8,745 | 8 | content length `u64` (encrypted) |
| 8,753 | 5,551 | content and random padding (encrypted) |
| 14,304 | 32 | body `T` |

Sum: 16 + 8,537 + 16 + 144 + 32 + 8 + 5,551 + 32 = **14,336**. Content capacity `REQUEST_CAPACITY` = 5,551 B.

The AD of the slot header and of the body is `hdr16 ‖ initial block` (8,553 B), so the initial block cannot be swapped. A request envelope has no PQ slot and no capsule; its slot header never sets the PQ-slot flag.

### 6.1 Initial-message block: 8,537 B

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | EnclaveCombine suite ID: 2 or 3 |
| 1 | 1 | mode: 0 Off the record, 1 On the record |
| 2 | 1 | PSK flag: 0 or 1 |
| 3 | 1 | reserved (written as zero; not checked) |
| 4 | 4 | `spk_id` (`u32`) |
| 8 | 1 | PQ prekey kind: 1 one-time, 2 signed prekey, 3 last-resort |
| 9 | 8 | PQ prekey ID (`u64`): one-time `(batch_id << 16) ‖ index`; signed 0; last-resort `u32` ID |
| 17 | 56 | initiator ephemeral X448 key `EK_A` |
| 73 | 1,568 | `ct_pq` (ML-KEM-1024 to the chosen PQ prekey) |
| 1,641 | 208 | `ct_mce` (McEliece to the vault key; zero in the 2-KEM suite, not checked) |
| 1,849 | 1,568 | `ct_auth` (ML-KEM-1024 to the responder's device auth key) |
| 3,417 | 5,120 | sealed identity (`SEALED_IDENTITY_LEN`; compact seal, `04-eqxdh.md` §4) |

Sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 8 + 56 + 1,568 + 208 + 1,568 + 5,120 = **8,537** (`INITIAL_BLOCK_LEN = 4 + 4 + 9 + 56 + 1,568 + 208 + 1,568 + 5,120`).

## 7. Group stored envelope: 14,336 B

Implemented in `enclave-proto::group` (M7). The sender header (bytes 16–88), state hash and frontier are encrypted under the epoch header key and authenticated by the MAC vector (`07-groups.md`, implementation note 3). Layout from `enclave_wire::group`:

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 88 | sender header (the 16 B envelope header is folded into it) |
| 88 | 32 | state hash |
| 120 | 800 | causal frontier: 100 × 8 |
| 920 | 1,584 | MAC vector: 99 × 16 |
| 2,504 | 1,024 | capsule |
| 3,528 | 32 | body `N` |
| 3,560 | 8 | content length `u64` (encrypted) |
| 3,568 | 10,736 | content and random padding (encrypted) |
| 14,304 | 32 | body `T` |

Sum: 88 + 32 + 800 + 1,584 + 1,024 + 32 + 8 + 10,736 + 32 = **14,336**. Body offset 3,528 and content capacity 10,736 are compile-time assertions. In On-the-record groups a 4,741 B signature would leave 5,995 B.

This is PLAN §8's field order. The contents of the 88 B sender header and the protection of the state hash and frontier (which reveal group structure if left in the clear) are decided when groups are implemented (`07-groups.md`; `00-overview.md` §9, I-14).

## 8. Rekey unit (reserved, not implemented)

The M0 draft's dedicated rekey layout, re-derived for the 64 B seal overhead: routing header 88 + seal overhead 64 + payload 14,184 = 14,336. Payload: state hash 32 + common blob (64 + 128) 192 + bucket info 8 + 174 entries × 80 B 13,920 + zero 32 = 14,184. Nothing in the code defines this layout yet.

## 9. Blobs and directory objects

### 9.1 Blob chunk: 14,336 B

`enclave_wire::BLOB_CHUNK_CAPACITY` = 14,336 − 16 − 72 = 14,248 B of data per chunk. The chunk layout this reserves:

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 16 | header (version 1, kind 3 `Blob`, 14 zero) |
| 16 | 32 | `N` |
| 48 | 8 | data length `u64` (encrypted) |
| 56 | 14,248 | chunk data and padding (encrypted) |
| 14,304 | 32 | `T` |

Sum: 16 + 32 + 8 + 14,248 + 32 = **14,336**.

The server stores a `BlobPut` envelope region as is under its 32 B chunk ID and returns it on `BlobGet`. Client-side blob sealing (chunk keys and IDs from a blob secret, `02b-key-schedule.md` §9) is not implemented yet; the labels are reserved.

### 9.2 Attachment buckets

An attachment is padded to the smallest bucket that holds it (`enclave_wire::bucket_for`); attachments over 100 MiB (`MAX_ATTACHMENT`) are refused. A bucket needs `n_B = ⌈B / 14,248⌉` chunks (`chunks_for_bucket`). Each chunk carries its own length field, so a bucket's capacity is 14,248 · `n_B`.

| Bucket | Nominal size (B) | Chunks `n_B` | Capacity (B) = 14,248·`n_B` | Stored bytes (14,336·`n_B`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 KiB | 65,536 | 5 | 71,240 | 71,680 |
| 256 KiB | 262,144 | 19 | 270,712 | 272,384 |
| 1 MiB | 1,048,576 | 74 | 1,054,352 | 1,060,864 |
| 4 MiB | 4,194,304 | 295 | 4,203,160 | 4,229,120 |
| 16 MiB | 16,777,216 | 1,178 | 16,784,144 | 16,887,808 |
| 64 MiB | 67,108,864 | 4,711 | 67,122,328 | 67,536,896 |
| 128 MiB | 134,217,728 | 9,421 | 134,230,408 | 135,059,456 |

Each chunk crosses the network as one 16,384 B wire unit (upload) or reply unit (download).

### 9.3 Directory payloads

Directory objects (manifests, prekey publications, claimed bundles, the vault-key object) travel as chunks of at most `CHUNK_DATA` = 14,000 B inside API frames (§2.3). They are not blob chunks.

`DirRequest` (78 B fixed part):

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | kind: 1 `Manifest`, 2 `Bundle`, 3 `Vault` |
| 1 | 1 | action: 1 `Put`, 2 `Get`, 3 `Claim` |
| 2 | 32 | key (manifest key, device key, vault locator, or claim ID) |
| 34 | 4 | chunk index (`u32`) |
| 38 | 4 | total chunks (`u32`; `Put` only) |
| 42 | 32 | proof: PoW for `Claim`, owner secret for `Vault` `Put`, otherwise unused |
| 74 | 4 | data length (`u32`, at most 14,000) |
| 78 | ≤ 14,000 | chunk data (`Put` only) |

`DirReply` (40 B fixed part):

| Offset | Length | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | total chunks of the object |
| 4 | 32 | claim ID (bundle claims) or zero |
| 36 | 4 | data length |
| 40 | variable | chunk data |

Both fit the 14,332 B payload limit: 78 + 14,000 = 14,078.

Object sizes (canonical encodings, `enclave-proto`):

| Object | Size (B) | Chunks of 14,000 B |
|---|---|---|
| Signed manifest, `n` devices, request-inbox locator of `L` B | 4 + (287 + `L` + 4,250·`n`) + 29,792 | 3 for `n` = 1 (34,365 B with `L` = 32); 4 for `n` = 5 (51,365 B with `L` = 32) |
| Prekey publication (signed prekey, batch of 100 OPKs with paths, last-resort) | 202,527 | 15 |
| Claimed bundle with a one-time prekey | 19,376 | 2 |
| Claimed bundle without a one-time prekey | 12,731 | 1 |
| Vault-key object | opaque to the server (`enclave-sim` seals the 1,357,824 B key as 23 segments of ≤ 60,000 B: 1,359,388 B) | 98 in the simulator |

Derivations: `math/envelope-budget.md` §8.

## 10. Size invariants

`enclave-wire` contains these compile-time assertions:

```
UNIT_SEALED_OFFSET == 1_628                      # 4 + 56 + 1_568
UNIT_SEALED_LEN    == 14_472                     # 72 + 14_336 + 64
UNIT_PADDING_LEN   == 284                        # 16_384 − 1_628 − 14_472
POLL_PADDING_LEN   == 284                        # 2_048 − 1_628 − 136
direct::PQ == 816 && direct::CAPSULE == 4_080 && direct::BODY == 5_104
direct::CONTENT_CAPACITY == 9_160                # 14_336 − 5_104 − 72
group::BODY == 3_528
group::CONTENT_CAPACITY == 10_736                # 14_336 − 3_528 − 72
```

Run-time checks and tests: `WireUnit::decode` and `PollRequest::decode` reject any length other than 16,384 and 2,048; `seal_direct` checks that every slot is 160 B, the PQ slot 3,264 B, and the envelope 14,336 B; `seal_request` checks the initial block (8,537 B) and the envelope length; `enclave-wire` tests `unit_roundtrip_and_exact_size`, `poll_roundtrip`, `header_roundtrip_and_reserved_check`, `padding_roundtrip`, `body_fits_sealed_region`, `buckets`; `enclave-sim` checks that the server only ever stores 14,336 B objects (`Server::stored_lengths`).

## 11. Parsing and errors

- A receiver checks the exact object size first, then version and suite (units and polls) or version and kind (envelopes), and only then attempts any cryptographic operation.
- Every parse or authentication failure on a network path is a silent drop. The server's answer to an undecryptable request is 16,384 random bytes; its answer to a well-formed request that fails authorization is a sealed reply with a non-`Ok` status. Both are full reply units.
- Parsers are fuzzed (`20-assurance.md` §1; not yet set up).

## Open questions

1. Op codes (§2.2) are provisional; PLAN's op list (group writes, blob allocation with Privacy Pass, inbox registration with PoW, push registration, capabilities, deletion, KT writes and queries) is not implemented.
2. The envelope header's kind byte tells the server whether it stores a direct or request envelope. The server already knows this from the inbox type, so nothing new leaks today; it would matter if request and account inboxes were ever merged.
3. The vault-key object has its own size (98 directory chunks in the simulator), and directory objects of different kinds have different chunk counts. They cross the network inside uniform units, but a fetch sequence of a given length reveals the object kind. Padding every directory object to a common chunk count is open.
4. Settled in M7: the state hash and frontier stay in PLAN §8's positions but are encrypted under the epoch header key and covered by the MAC vector (I-14).
