# Deploying an Enclave stack

One operator runs one stack: the server (keys, inboxes, key-transparency
log), a witness (cosigns other operators' logs), the front (the stack's
only HTTPS surface), a call relay and, optionally, a push relay. They come
as one image, `ghcr.io/enclavechat/enclave-server`, and one compose file,
`ops/compose/compose.yml`. See `docs/12-servers.md` for what each part does.

> **Status.** Production servers are reached only through the Nym mixnet,
> by the ingress sidecar (`ghcr.io/enclavechat/enclave-nym`, compose
> profile `nym`). It becomes the only way in once milestone S4 makes the
> production compose Nym-only. Until then a stack can be run and tested
> (the CI job `federation-e2e-tcp` runs three), but it is not ready for
> users.

## What you need

- A Linux host with Docker Engine 24 or later and the compose plugin.
- A domain name whose A/AAAA records point at the host.
- Open ports: 80 and 443/tcp (the front; 80 answers ACME challenges and
  redirects), 51820/udp (call relay). Nothing else is published.
- The foundation's public key and signed server list (`foundation.pub`,
  `server-list.bin`), from the foundation.

## First start

```sh
cd ops/compose
cp .env.example .env          # DOMAIN, OPERATOR, FAMILY, ACME_EMAIL, RELAY_PUBLIC_ADDR
for f in config/*.toml.example; do cp "$f" "${f%.example}"; done
cp /path/to/foundation.pub /path/to/server-list.bin foundation/

docker compose run --rm server init     # creates keys, prints the server id
docker compose run --rm witness init    # prints the witness id
docker compose run --rm relay init      # prints the relay descriptor
```

`OPERATOR` and `FAMILY` must be honest (see `operator-family.md`).

## Joining the foundation's list

Sign descriptors and send them to the foundation:

```sh
mkdir -p out && chmod 0777 out
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" server  descriptor /out/server.bin  --config /etc/enclave/server.toml
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" witness descriptor /out/witness.bin --config /etc/enclave/witness.toml
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" relay   descriptor /out/relay.bin   --config /etc/enclave/relay.toml
```

The foundation checks them (`enclave-admin descriptor verify`), adds the
stack to the next list, and names the other operators' witnesses that will
cosign your log. Put those in `config/server.toml`:

```toml
[kt]
witnesses = ["https://witness-operator-b.example", "https://witness-operator-c.example"]
```

Then start everything:

```sh
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps                 # every service "healthy"
```

Check what the world sees:

```sh
enclave-admin descriptor fetch your.domain --id <server id>
```

## Updating the list

When the foundation publishes a new list, replace `foundation/server-list.bin`.
The server and the witness pick it up within a minute; nothing restarts.
They take it only if it verifies and is newer.

## Updating the software

Set `ENCLAVE_VERSION` in `.env` to the new release (or pin a digest:
`ENCLAVE_VERSION=1.2.0@sha256:…`), then:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Releases are reproducible: building the published commit with
`ops/docker/Dockerfile` gives the same binaries (`cargo xtask repro`). From
the first release, images and their provenance are signed (cosign, keyless,
from the release workflow):

```sh
cosign verify ghcr.io/enclavechat/enclave-server:<version> \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/EnclaveChat/Enclave/'
```

## Backups

Two things must survive a lost host, and they are backed up differently:

1. **State** (`server-data` volume): the server writes consistent snapshots
   of its database and key-transparency log every `[backup] interval_hours`
   into the `backups` volume and keeps the newest `keep`. Copy that volume
   off the host regularly. You may also take one by hand while the server
   is stopped: `docker compose run --rm server backup /var/lib/enclave/backups`.
2. **Keys** (`server-keys`, `witness-keys`, `relay-keys`, `push-keys`
   volumes): written once by `init`. They are not in the snapshots. Back
   them up once, **encrypted**, to a place that is not the host, for
   example with `age`:

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -v enclave_server-keys:/k:ro alpine tar -C /k -cf - . | age -r <recipient> > server-keys.tar.age
   ```

   Losing the server's identity key means a new server id: every account
   on it would have to move (`docs/12-servers.md` §4.4). Losing the
   key-transparency head key or VRF secret breaks the pins every client
   holds for your log.

The key-transparency log must be backed up (`docs/13-operators.md` §5):
witnesses refuse a log that goes back in time.

## Restoring

```sh
docker compose stop server
# keys first, if the volume is new
docker run --rm -i -v enclave_server-keys:/k alpine tar -C /k -xf - < server-keys.tar   # decrypted
docker compose run --rm server restore /var/lib/enclave/backups/server-<time>.redb
docker compose start server
```

`restore` puts the server and key-transparency snapshots taken at the
same moment back, keeping the files it replaces as `*.redb.old`.

## State in PostgreSQL (optional)

The server keeps its state in a redb file in the `server-data` volume by
default. To keep it in PostgreSQL instead (`docs/12-servers.md` §6):

```sh
mkdir -p secrets
pw=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
printf '%s' "$pw" > secrets/postgres_password
printf 'postgres://enclave:%s@postgres/enclave' "$pw" > secrets/database_url
chmod 0444 secrets/database_url
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

Use the same `-f` pair for every later command. The database is reachable
only on the stack's internal network. Snapshots in the `backups` volume
stay redb files and are taken while the server runs; `restore` loads one
into PostgreSQL in a single transaction. The key-transparency log stays in
`server-data`, so keep backing that volume's snapshots up too. Moving an
existing stack: stop the server, take a `backup`, switch to
`compose.postgres.yml`, and `restore` that snapshot.

## Keys and rotation

- **Request keys** rotate every day by themselves, from a forward-secure
  chain. Yesterday's is kept for late requests; older ones can't be
  recovered from disk.
- **Push relay keys** rotate every 30 days with a 7-day overlap; the
  published file is `public/push-relay-keys.bin`. A push relay operator
  also runs `push-ingress` (profile `push`), whose Nym address
  (`public/push-ingress.addr`) goes into the foundation's list with the
  keys.

## Push

With profile `nym`, `push-egress` carries the server's due wakes to the
push relay over the mixnet. Set `PUSH_RELAY_NYM` in `.env` to the relay's
Nym address from the foundation's list, and in `config/server.toml`:

```toml
[push]
forward = "push-egress:7446"
```
- **Call relay ticket keys** rotate daily.
- **Identity keys** (server, witness, relay) don't rotate: they are what
  the foundation's list names. Replacing one is leaving the list and
  joining again with a new descriptor.
- **TLS**: the front renews its certificate from Let's Encrypt when 30
  days are left (`TLS_MODE=acme`), or re-reads your files hourly
  (`TLS_MODE=files`).

## Descriptor publishing

The server signs a fresh descriptor at start and at every daily key
rotation. It serves it to clients, writes it for the front
(`https://your.domain/.well-known/enclave`), and commits its digest to its
key-transparency log, so it can't show different clients different
descriptors.

## Nix

A Nix flake with the same pinned toolchain arrives with the release
pipeline (milestone R2). Until then, use the image or build from source
(`cargo build --release --locked -p enclave-server`).
