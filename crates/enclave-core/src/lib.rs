//! The Enclave client engine (`docs/15-client.md`).
//!
//! `enclave-core` runs in the vault process. It owns every long-term secret,
//! drives the protocol crates against servers through a [`Transport`], and
//! keeps all state in the sealed [`enclave_store::Store`]. The UI talks to it
//! through the command methods on [`Client`] and the [`Event`]s that
//! [`Client::sync`] returns; it never sees key material.
//!
//! Invariants:
//! * Ratchet state is persisted **before** the envelope it produced leaves the
//!   device, and after every envelope that changed it, so a crash can lose a
//!   message but never reuse a key.
//! * Prekeys consumed by a handshake are persisted before the session is used.
//! * Nothing from a stranger is shown until it has authenticated, and it lands
//!   in message requests until the user accepts it.
//!
//! [`Transport`]: enclave_net::transport::Transport
