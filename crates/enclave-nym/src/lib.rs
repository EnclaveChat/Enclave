//! Enclave over the Nym mixnet (`docs/09-transport.md` §1, §7).
//!
//! A client sends each sealed request to the destination server's Nym
//! address with fresh single-use reply blocks (SURBs) and a fresh sender
//! tag; the server's ingress (`enclave-ingress`) forwards it to the server
//! and answers over those SURBs. Everything here is independent of
//! nym-sdk: the frames that cross the mixnet ([`frame`]), the interface a
//! mixnet client offers ([`MixnetDriver`]), and an in-process mixnet with
//! loss, delay and reordering for tests ([`fake::FakeMixnet`]).
//!
//! The nym-sdk driver lives in the separate `nym/` workspace: nym-sdk and
//! arti (Tor) link different, conflicting versions of SQLite, so they can't
//! share one lockfile, and the processes that run them are separate anyway
//! (the stack's ingress; the client's mixnet process beside netd).
