//! Messages between the UI process and the vault process
//! (`docs/15-client.md` §1, process split).
//!
//! The vault process owns every key and runs the client engine; the UI process
//! renders and never sees key material. They exchange exactly three things:
//!
//! * [`Cmd`]: what the person did (UI → vault);
//! * [`Snapshot`]: everything the window shows, as plain display data
//!   (vault → UI);
//! * [`Effect`]: a few one-off UI resets, such as closing a sheet after a
//!   request succeeded (vault → UI).
//!
//! Framing is `u32 BE length ‖ body` with a hard size cap, and a connection
//! starts with a 32-byte token the UI passed to the vault it spawned, so no
//! other local process can pose as the vault. Every decoder rejects trailing
//! bytes and oversize fields; the UI treats the vault's output as data, and
//! the vault treats commands as untrusted input.
