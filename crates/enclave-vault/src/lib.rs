//! The Enclave vault (`docs/15-client.md` §1, process split).
//!
//! The vault runs the client engine: it owns `enclave_core::Client` and with
//! it every long-term key, the sealed store and the network. The UI talks to
//! it only through [`enclave_ipc`] commands and display snapshots.
//!
//! On desktop the vault is its own process (`enclave-vault`), started by the
//! UI with a one-time token on its stdin and connected back over a Unix socket
//! in a private directory. Where that isn't possible (Windows for now, mobile
//! platforms, tests) the same engine runs on a thread ([`engine::spawn`]).
