//! Key transparency (`docs/12-servers.md` §12.2).
//!
//! Each Enclave server runs an append-only verifiable map from usernames to
//! account root keys, built on Meta's audited `akd` library with an Enclave
//! configuration that hashes with SHAKE256 (SHA-3 family). On top of `akd`:
//!
//! * **Signed tree heads**: `(server, epoch, root, time)` signed with the
//!   server's composite Ed448 + ML-DSA-87 key.
//! * **Witnesses** cosign a head only after checking an append-only proof from
//!   the last head they cosigned, so a server cannot show different users
//!   different histories without a quorum of witnesses colluding.
//! * **Clients** accept a lookup only with the server signature and at least
//!   `threshold` cosignatures from their pinned witness list. The median witness
//!   timestamp is Enclave's trusted time.
//! * **Gossip**: a 32-byte digest of the latest head rides in message padding
//!   between contacts, so split views surface even without witnesses.
//!
//! Label privacy uses akd's classical ECVRF (Ed25519). That only hides
//! usernames from enumeration; binding is hash-based and post-quantum.
