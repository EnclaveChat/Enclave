//! dudect-style timing tests (Reparaz, Balasch and Verbauwhede, "Dude, is my
//! code constant time?", 2017): time an operation on two classes of input
//! that differ only in secret-dependent ways, and run Welch's t-test on the
//! two timing distributions. |t| > 10 is a clear leak; below 4.5 no leak was
//! found at this sample size. Timings are also cropped at the 50th and 90th
//! percentiles, as dudect does, so rare outliers (interrupts) don't hide or
//! fake a difference.
//!
//! A deliberately leaky comparison is the control: the harness must flag it,
//! or a pass means nothing. Both classes use the same buffer, rewritten
//! before each untimed step, so allocation and alignment can't differ
//! between them.
//!
//! `Instant` can't resolve a 32-byte comparison (even the leaky one looks
//! constant there), so comparisons are tested on 4 KiB and the rest through
//! the operations that use them. See `docs/20-assurance.md` for results.
//!
//! Slow and sensitive to machine noise, so ignored by default:
//! `cargo xtask dudect`.
