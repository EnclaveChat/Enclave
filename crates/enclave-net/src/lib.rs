//! Enclave networking (`docs/09-transport.md`).

//! * [`transport`]: how sealed requests reach servers. Production uses Nym over
//!   Tor; development uses plain TCP; tests use an in-memory network.
//! * [`schedule`]: the cover-traffic scheduler. Every client in a given
//!   profile emits exactly the same traffic shape whatever the user does: real
//!   messages *replace* cover slots, polls rotate through mailboxes one per
//!   request, and only three global profiles exist, because any per-user
//!   tuning would become a fingerprint.
